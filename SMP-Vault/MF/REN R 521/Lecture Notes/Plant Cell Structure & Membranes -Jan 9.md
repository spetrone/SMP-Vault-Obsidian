Why cell membranes for stress physiology:
- >50% effects on response at cell membrane
- affects transportation
- proteins embedded in cell membrane:
	- transporters, enzymes, etc.
	- even if protein not directly affected, the environment is
- how can plants modify the proteins to handle the stress


- responses occur at the cell level
- membranes compartmentalize parts within the cell as well

Stress signals:
- start from outer environment, therefore
	- received first by cell wall

### Cell Wall
- main function: structure; relatively permeable 
- secondary (peripheral) functions more related to stimuli from outer environment:
	- 
- thickness  varies
	- thin cell wall is more flexible - stretch, control properties - cell and plant can grow better
	- once thicker cell walls are deposited - cannot expand, more structure, prevent damaged, etc.
		- e.g. wood - with secondary cell walls - rigidity and mechanical strength


### Plasma Membrane
- functional - must remain in certain structure for certain proteins to function
		- lipid bilayer - most have unique properties to by both hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups
			- phospholipids typically
		- peripheral (extrinsic protein)
		- integral (intrinsic proteins) - spans through bilayer
		- proteins - subunits - polypeptides
			- functional 3D shapes - determined from their environment; in this case - lipid bilayer - determines shape along with A.A. sequence
			- e.g. channels (like gates), carriers (through bilayer)
- receives and responds to signals and stimuli
	- signaling pathways often begin at the membrane
		- released into cytoplasm leading to chain reactions to certain response
- sterols contribute to the control functionality of membrane

##### Phospholipid Bilayer 
lipid:
- polar/hydrophilic phosphate head + hydrophobic two fatty acid
- membranes *must* remain in the ***"fluid"*** (semicrystalline) phase to be functional. Once they enter the "solid" (gel) phase, they lose their functionality
	- determined by: its composition (especially fatty acids), temperature, 
	- fatty acids are mobile - tails can move, whole lipid can move around membrane

###### head: 
- Head group e.g. ethanolamine, choline, inositol
- phosphate
- glycerol

###### fatty acid chains:
- saturated or unsaturated, polyunsaturated
	- - saturation determines maximum temperature, melting temperature and enthalpy
- fluidity depends on number and locations of double bonds and the length of the carbon chain (number of C atoms)
- longer/more C == higher melting point
- more double bonds == lower melting point
	
- Temperature, particularly cold stress, greatly affects the lipids in plants - affecting cell membranes and their proteins
	- - COLDER TEMPS - needs oils with lower melting points to remain fluid - more polyunsaturated fatty acids - more frost resistant
		- e.g. canola oil - 6-14% a-linolenic acid; 50-60% oleic acid, and <7% saturated fat
	- In tropical climates - more saturated fatty acids because temperatures are warm 

e.g. stearic-acid
determined by number of carbon atoms in the chain and the number of double bonds
e.g. C14-0 - 14 C atoms, no double bonds = saturated
e.g. C18-2 : 18 C atoms, 2 double bonds = unsaturated
	
e.g. C18-0 - stearic acid, C18-1 oleic acid (olive oil)

- different head groups and chains create different phospholipids with different characteristics:
	- e.g. Monoacyl PC, phosphatidylcholine

##### Galactolipids
- present mainly in chloroplast membranes 
- in some bacteria - reinforces theory of chloroplasts being symbiotic unicellular organisms that were consumed
- two fatty acid chains


##### Plant Sterols - control the fluidity - often in localized areas
e.g.
- campesterol
- sitosterol
- brassicasterol
- stigma asterol
- avenasterol

### Water pathways through tissue:
1. apoplastic : around cells ; impeded by Casparian strip
2. transmembrane : crosses membranes, through cells
3. symplastic transport: through symplast (through plasmodesmata cell walls) 
cell-to-cell groups both : transmembrane and symplastic (we do not understand symplastic very well.)

- water will follow pathway of least resistance
###### Aquaporins
- transmembrane water transport is controlled by **aquaporins** which are proteins embedded in the cell membrane
	- control water transport particularly in response to stresses
	- sensitive to environmental stresses
	- need energy to open (ATP) / to stay open 
- 4 protein sub-units (complex 3D structure to maintain opening)
	- **tetrameric pores:** each has a opening/pore that can open and close
	- **centropore:**  a pore in the middle of all subunits
			- scientists puzzled; believe involved in oxygen transport
