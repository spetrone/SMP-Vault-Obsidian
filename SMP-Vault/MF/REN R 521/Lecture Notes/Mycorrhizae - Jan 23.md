- associate with plant roots and form a symbiotic relationship
- host plant provides sugars (carbon) for the fungus.
- the fungus provides essential mineral nutrients such as P and N to the host plant, facilitates water uptake, and protects plants from abiotic and biotic stresses
- ascetomycetes and basitomycels produce spores from fruiting bodies (mushroom)
- fungi need carbon source - some are saprophytic, but these mcorrhizal fungi form symbiotic relationships to obtain carbon
	- but must help trees:
		- protect against soil pollutants
		- water uptake
		- nutrient uptake
		- pathogen protection
	- balance is not always perfect
		- e.g. weak tree cannot provide food to fungus - may further weaken tree

- many soils have conditions that would not support forests but Mycorrhizas allow trees to go

- in nature, 95% of plants form mycorrhizal associations
	- some exceptions - cabbage (Brassicaceae), Cyperaceae, Juncaceae --> but still have some associations it seems (recent research)

- many fungi are not specific - many will colonize any plants


- hyphae maybe 1% of thickness of root - can go into much smaller pores
	- only present in very young roots not in woody/ older roots
		- no secondary tissues - only associate with roots with primary tissues only
		- in older trees only a few cm of newest roots
-
- when plants have mycorrhizal roots, replaces root hairs

- can find multiple species in roots
	- helpful against pathogens - competition - prevent pathogenic fungi from entering

- **ectomycorrhizae** - do not penetrate individual cells within the root
	- **basidiomycetes (mostly) and ascomycetes**
	- mantle hyphae - mat on epidermis with hyphae that extend into soil
		- up to 40 microns thick - with hypae extending into the surrounding soil
	- inside the root --> in between cell walls with what is called a hartig net
		- in gymnosperms hartig nets extend all the way to the endodermis (the last inner cortical tissue) with casparian strips and suberized cell walls
		- in angiosperms - not as extensive and does not extend into endodermis, because the angiosperms have another barrier layer - the exodermis with casparian strips and suberized cell walls
	-  ectomycorrhizals mostly trees in **Boreal forests and temperature forests** - probably because of co-evolution over million of years where certain trees allow the invasion of certain species of fungi - some specificity when it involves the species of fungi that are capable of colonizing certain species
	- tamarack (has a specific species), spruce, pine, birch, 

- endomycorrhizae - penetrate the cell wall and invaginate the cell membrane
	- vam - vesicular arbuscualar mycorrhizae - most common
		- form arbuscles and balloon-like vesicles for storage
	- do not have fruiting bodies (mushrooms)
		- produce chlamydospores insread
	- 70% of all plants
	- the hyphaw of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi produce the glycoprotein glomalin which may be one of the major stores of carbon in the soil
	- Arum-type and Paris-type
	- Paris type: coils
	- Arum type - 
	- trees that use endomycorrhizae (such as nearly all fruit species - apples, plums, cherries, etc., mountain ash, green ash, black ash, elm, poplar/trembling aspen, willow, 
	- cedars



	- poplar/trembling aspen have BOTH endo and ecto

- 
- ectendomycorrhizae







non-mycorrhizal examples:

- oyster
	- can be saprophytic or pathological
	- aspen - fruiting bodies in June in AB
	- living or dead trees


- leccinum boreale - edible - ecto
	- by Aspen
	- often have maggots

- boletus edulis - oak trees - ecto
- matsuke - old growth pine - ecto
- amanita muscaria - fly control - ecto
- rusula metica - ecto - white spruce
- hebeloma crustuliniforme - ecto - new genome published
- laccaria bicolor - ecto - new genome published
- suillus tomentosus - pine forest (jack pine, lodgepole pine) - lichen
