## Macroelements

1. Carbon, Hydrogen, O2
- modulated by stomata
- mycorrhizae allow uptake of water which is needed to regulate the opening of stomata --> therefore mycorrhizae regulate uptake of CO2

17 Nutrients
- Macro elements
	- Pi
	- K
	- N
	- S
	- Mg
	- Ca
- Micro nutrients:
	- Fe
	- Mn
	- B
	- Ni
	- Cl
	- Cu
	- Zn
	- Mo

*some plants have additonal requirements* (Na, Si)
e.g. halophytes (some trees - mangrove trees) require Na - obligate and facultative halophytes
- facultative halophytes- can live with high salt but don't need it (level high - 20 dcms/m) 
- obligative halophytes - need sodium to survive

- Mycorrhizae also prevent the uptake by plants of 
	- sodium
	- heavy metals - lead, mercury
	- Aluminum
*how do they know what is helpful and what is harmful?*
- it is harmful to them so they prevent
- mechanisms : chelation


Mechanisms of Mycorrhiza on nutrient uptake:
- solubilization of normally insoluble compounds with the elements
- protection from soil pathogens

Root length
- plant may become dependent on fungi - an issue when mycorrhizae might die off
	- e.g. mycorrhizae more susceptible to both drought and flood

Existence of Myccorhizae
- ECM can exist outside of roots so long as they get their sugar
- VAM cannot exist outside of roots - requires association with cells
- growth of both partners is influenced by
	- the host plant genotype
	- the VAM species and ecotype
	- the soil, but is not necessarily related to soil fertility or the percentage of root infection
	- *roots may not let infection take hold - a lot of carbon can be lost , sometime 10-20% but up to 40%*
- difficult to correlate the extent of colonization and the benefit of the relationship

Variation in mantle and Hartig net & penetration of root cortex
- somewhat based on physiology of roots
	- e.g. endodermis, exodermis, casparian strips, etc.
		- e.g. in conifers with no exodermis there is deeper penetration
- 

Nitrogen
- ammonium is toxic if it accumulates - charged and can produce ammonia gas
- main form of nitrogen is ammonium in boreal soils 
- boreal species have mechanisms to handle this toxicity
	- e.g. white spruce, black spruce- quite tolerant of ammonia - aspen is not
		- so it may have mechanisms to tolerate ammonium like sacrificial mechanisms
- boreal species hypothesized to be getting help in getting nitrate from somewhere


Phosphorus
- ectoenzymes excreted to break down phosphate/phosphorus compounds
	- evident with ECM/EM, but not so evident with VAM
	- e.g. with ECM/EM --> oxalic acid - solubalizes phosphorus
		- in Calcareous soils may release phosphate from Calcium Phosphate
