Robert day - How to write and Publish a Scientific Paper

# Title
- The fewest possible words that adequately describe the contents of the paper
- They can be too short
- Too often, they are too long

**Overexpression of NTPIP1.3 enhances aerobic metabolism in Brassica Napus when exposed to to root hypoxia by altering glycolysis, pyruvate metabolism and the TCA cycle.**



*note on conclusions*: often given three times: once in the abstract, again in the introduction, and again, in more detail, in the discussion.
## Abstract
- tell a story
- write at the very end of a paper; after discussion
- principal objects and scope of investigation
	- methods employed (briefly)
	- summarize results
	- state the principal conclusions
- past tense
	- except for common knowledge/ well-established knowledge, then it can be present tense; so never your own study
- should never give any information or conclusion that is not given in the paper
- economy of words
	- exclude any extraneous detail


## Introduction
- goal is to provide enough information that further study on the topic is not needed to understand the paper and results
- provide a background for the topic
	- (1) nature and scope of the problem being investigated
	- (2) background
		- e.g. knowledge gap 
	- (3) method of investigation (brief)
		- e.g. observational
		- e.g. closed chambers, etc. etc.
		- sometimes provide reasons for methods - especially with weird/rare or unorthodox methods
	- (3) objectives
	- (4) hypothesis (depends on study)
		- usually the hypothesis will be changed if it was originally wrong -lol
	- (5) Hint or state results of the investigation, towards the end
		- state the principal conclusions hinted by the results
- may be read by people outside narrow specialty
	- therefore, introduction to the paper should include definitions of any specialized terms or abbreviations


## Materials and Methods
- should be enough information to allow someone else to repeat the study and come up with the same results; is this truly possible though?; still is the objective;
- state all details of:
	- materials used - what and where they came from
	- equipment used + manufacturer and version
- details of the methods
	- locations, methods, processes, etc. everything
- look at methods
	- how well described
	- how appropriate
	- did they allow the authors to make the conclusions that they made?
- for plants, include both scientific name and authority name - might have multiple
- Describe the statistics, and the statistics should be meaningful

Headings/Subheadings
- can help finding areas of paper, use them!
- can add nested headings in discussion, not as common, not ideal


### Results 
- should not start it by describing methods that were omitted from materials and methods
- Best results section is a very short one
- Show your figures and your tables; no need to describe everything in the tables and figures
- shorter the better
- highlight the important things, but there can be a lot of data and tables with many elements and treatments; you cannot describe them all and no need

- ingredients:
	- overall description of experiments providing the big picture without however repeating the experimental details previously provided in Materials and Methods
	- present data in past tense
		- present tables only if necessary; if too many to put in figures; avoid when possible
- All tables and figures should stand on their own -  a mini paper in the caption

## Discussion
- hard to define, hard to write;
- papers often rejected for faulty discussions, even if results are valid and interesting
- interpretation of discussion may obscure results and cause a rejection

**components**
- try to present the principle, relationships and generalizations shown by the results; you discuss, you do not recapitulate the results
- point out any exceptions or any lack of correlation and define unsettled points. Never take the high-risk alternatives of trying to cover up or fudge data that do not quite fit
- show how your results and interpretations agree with previously published work
- Don't be shy; discuss the theoretical implications of your work, as well as any possible practical applications.  
- State your conclusions as clearly as possible. 
- Summarize your evidence for each conclusion. Or, as the wise old scientist will tell you, "Never assume anything except a 4% mortgage."


- must notice significance - don't miss the forest for the trees (data)
- best scientific papers tell a story
