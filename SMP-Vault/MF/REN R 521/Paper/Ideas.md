1. Tree phenology in response to climate change 

1.  Understood mechanisms in tree phenology
2.  Mechanisms / pool for change
3.  Responses to climate change

- variation effect on phenological spreads and adaptive potential
	- epi-genetic variation
	- symbiotically-linked variation (i.e. genomes better or less co-evolved with mycchorizae)
	- genetic variation
	- species variation
	- age structure variation (linked with epi-genetics) - i.e. the memory of the forest


2. Nitrogen symbioses
