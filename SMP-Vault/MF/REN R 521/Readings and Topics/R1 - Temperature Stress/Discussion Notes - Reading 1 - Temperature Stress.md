Temperature important to:
- photosynthesis
- growth response (requires photosynthates)

- Topt - optimal temperature
- net photosynthesis is area between respiration and photosynthesis curves - 0 at higher temperatures and a little bit below 0


**Freezing injury:**
	- can be caused by intracellular freezing of the cell content or indirectly by dehydration of tissues resulting from extracellular freezing
		- crystals cause physical damage if inside cells
		- **dehydration***: water potential of frozen ice is very low and water moves from intracellular space to intercellular space - there are mechanisms for plants to attempt to prevent this
	- plants are usually killed by formation of ice crystals within the cells, but formation of ***ice crystals*** in the intercellular spaces is not always fatal
	- slow cooling- freezing first happens were solution is more diluted (outside of protoplast), solutes antifreeze properties; as temperature decreases, water moves out of the cells to these ice nuclei - so the protoplast gets more concentrated and more resistant to freezing
		- if really slow - more water escapes creating more shrinkage from high electrolyte concentration --> causes plasmolysis
	- optimal cooling - a little bit faster - some dehydration but avoids intracellular ice formation.
	- fast cooling - the intracellular water freezes/ice formation -more likely to kill cell - like early frost
	- ultra-rapid cooling - may lead to vitrification - like cryopreservation - no ice formation; cells and extracellular matrix vitrify - water turns into glass phase - no ice crystals, amorphous


**Supercooling**
	- refers to the cooling of liquid below the freezing temprature that is expected based on the solute concentration
		- water remains liquid, up to even - 40C
		- without any points of nucleation, water will not freeze
		- common in woody plants, particularly xylem ray paranchyma cells
		- supercooling can occur readily in very small volumes of water where surface properties influence the free energy of water, particularly in the absence of nucleation particles
		- likelihood of ice nucleation increases until -40 - when homogenous nucleation occurs
		- The - 40° C limit can be lowered in proportion to the osmotic concentration of the cell sap or raised by the presence of heterogeneous nucleators (e.g., caused by bacteria or various injuries).

##### Adaptation to Extracellular Freezing in Extremely cold environment
- Tree species that exist in extremely cold environments where the annual minimal temperature is significantly less than - 40° C, are generally thought to rely only on extracellular freezing, as this mechanism has the potential to allow survival even at the temperature of liquid nitrogen (- 196° C).
- antifreeze - certain solutes can prevent or lower freezing temperature

What might allow phospholipids to re-integrate into cell membrane after deyhdradion injury when they were released intracellularly
why is there a lower concentraion of nutrients in the soil at colder temperatures - lower energy ?



Why supercooling in woody plants?
- filtering particles?
- how to prevent gas bubbles in cell?
	- can membrane regulate gas influx? we don't know - traditionally we thought they are permeable to gases - not necessarily the way it is
		- there is some evidence that aquaporins can be involved in CO2 transport across the membrane - about 75% of scientists accept this a a fact - 25% argue that they are artifacts of experiments and procedures; since then a number of studies which clearly point to this that membranes can regulate CO2 transport
		- what about O2? - same story - thought they could diffuse through lipid bilary - however there is evidence that the cell membrane regulates this - more evidence growing that aquaporins are involved (e.g. AQP1 in humans) in O2 transportation
		- Nitrogen? - no research on nitrogen through cell membranes - main gas
	
How does cell membrane resist or prevent intracellular freezing when extracellular water is frozen?
- control over water transport
- solutes build up
