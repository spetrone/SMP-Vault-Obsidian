# Questions
**Question 1** - Specifically, what properties, mechanisms, or structural attributes allow woody plants to undergo significant supercooling? P. 55
	- For example, does this influence the increased tolerance of gymnosperms (with tracheary elements) vs. angiosperms (with vessel elements)?

**Question 2** - how does the plasma membrane prevent or resist intracellular freezing when the extracellular water is frozen?

Question 3 - When in a deep supercooled state - what is the effect on the function of the cell - particularly the membrane

**Question 3** - Where are we presently (post genomic revolution) with genetic engineering of plants for temperature tolerance? What about genomic studies and adaptive selection to apply to tree breeding?


# Notes

Topics:
1. Mechanisms of freezing avoidance and tolerance
2. effective cryprotectants
3. biochemical changes in nuclei acids, polyribosomes, amino acids, sugars, and ultrastructural comparisons
4. changes that occure in membranes that cause them to rupture, to alter structure leading to protoplast lysis, to bring about the disruption of active transport mechanisms, and to change lipid phases that affect membrane fluidity
5. Acclimation processes involving changes in proteins and the ffects of antimetabolites, surfactants, regulators, and other solutes on acclimation processes, supercooling events occurring primarily in woody species. What kinds of ice nucleators  occur and what are the genetic differences in degree of super cooling
6. Survival traits and breeding for the control of hardiness


##### Chilling injury - at all levels of cellular organization
- membranes are disorganized and cell dies
- browning, reduced growth, failure to germinate

##### Effect on membranes:
- critical temperature for injury 
- freeze-induced dehydration
- physical phase transition from liquid-crystalline to solid-gel
	- some molecular reordering in the membranes and therefore a change in fluidity occurs

##### Freezing
- first supercooling (temperature change to below freezing temperature)
- then freezing triggered by ice nucleators - materials that cause crystallization of the water - including ice crystals


### Freezing Process involving cells:
- water in cells and intercellular spaces supercools
- ice corms extracellularly because the solute concentration is lower and there are more effective ice nucleators present.
- intracellular nucleation is prevented by the plasmalemma
- since there is no contact of ice with intracellular water, a vapor pressure gradient is formed from inside to outside.
- an equilibrium is established either by the water evaporating out f the cell to the extracellular ice or by the formation of intracellular ice.
- the way in which the equilibrium is established depends on the rate of cooling in relation to the permability of the plasmalemma and the surface are to cell colume ration
- the amount of dehyrdation of the protoplasm that occurs depends on the intracellular osmolality. Whether the maximum amount of water is removed or not depends on the permeability of the plasmalemma and the surface area available for efflux (if flux is not adequate, the equilibrium is established by intracelullar ice formation, which is lethal to the cell)
- some liquid water or solution is not frozen
- injury become apparent only ipon thawing and some of the injury may be the result of the thawing process


##### Cell membrane injury 
- tangential pressure from cell shrinking due to dehydration induced with the interface - eventually exceed hydrophobic forces holding layer together and lipid is lost to the environment
- point of irreversible loss of membrane material coincides with limit of reversible plasmolysis
	- some may be able to be recaptured in membrane upon thawing - creates some resistance to cold stress


Hydraulic transport:
- Water transport and aquaporins are also likely related to chilling stress


### Effects of freeze-thaw cycles on plasma membranes
freeze thaw injury causes **a lytic lesion**:
1. contraction induced membrane alteration that decreases maximum critical surface area
2. an expansion-induced dissolution of the plasma membrane that occurs when the maximum critical surface area is exceeded
- little is known about molecular structure of membranes during contract and expansion processes - why it does not return to same volume
- presence or absence of sterols in the membrane also has an effect on the changes that take place during the freezing process
- may be linked to degree of unsaturation of membrane lipids, other lipid factors, soluble proteins and enzyme
	- as increase to 60% - phase transition point is lowered
	- presence of sterols may shift phase transition temperature lower


### Tolerance to Freezing stress
- things to tolerate: membrane plasmolysis, toxic solute concentration, extracellular freezing & subsequent dehydration of protoplast, adhesion due to cross bonding on rehydration
	- ##### No tolerance
		- frost damage - foliage becomes flaccid and water soaked; compartments in cells destroyed, membranes leaky;
		- only slight supercooling (-1 Cto -3C) - but still intracellular freezing & nucleation 
	- ###### limited tolerance (hardiness) 
		- limited supercooling (-1 to -2C)
		- intracellular ice formation rare
		- death from dehydration from water movement to intercellular ice
	- ##### cold tolerant (esp. woody species)
		- deep supercooling - down to -40C
		- bark and buds freeze extracellularly
		- xylem rays undergo deep supercooling; buds in domant state also deep supercool
		- other mechanisms for plants that don't supercool:
			- decrease solute concentration to prevent toxicity
			- ration of nontoxic to toxic compounds to dilute toxic compounds with non-toxic
			- protective compounds to decrease sensitivity of membranes to toxic compounds
			- collligative protection of solutes such as sugars and amino acids to prevent injury
			- synthesis of soluble proteins that in some way protect the cells from injury

- ## Effects of temperature on roots

- decrease water absorption raates -- causes water stress on plants
	- higher viscosity when cold - h bonding
	- decreases membrane permability
	- increase in dissolved CO2, O2 - higher solubility
		- lowers pH reducing water absorption further
- less nutrient abosption
	- less nutrients released in the soil solution from parent material - supply reduced
	- active transpport, translocation, and assimilaton processes in cells decrease
	- reduced fixation and nutrients produced from microbes
	- reduced photosynthates
	- reduction in synthesis and translocation of growth substances
	- increased nitrate updake and reduced nitrate reductase - therfeore more nitrate in roots


### High Temperature Effects
- high soil temp or high absorbed infrared radiation - exceeds tolerance of emerging plant part
- symptoms: necrotic lesions - esp. stems hypocotyls, chlorotic mottling of leave, fruits, needles, or death
- elevated temperatures in tissue due to not enough evaporative cooling
- Effects:
	- respiration and photosynthesis rates decrease
		- tissue may deteriorate due to lack of supporting energy
	- alterations to proteins:
		- enzyme temp ranges for activity may be exceeded
		- denaturation of effects on aggregation of proteins
		- alterations to membranes
		- all cause effects on metabolic processes that depend on these proteins and enzymes
	- lipid behavior changes - more fluid state - affects plasmolysis temp, cytoplasmic streaming, photosynthetic rate
	- Tolerance:
		- maintain photosynthesis at high temps
		- repair or synthesize strucutal protein
		- possession of substances that protect proteins from change
		- possibly lower hydration of protoplasm, more h-bonding, more tolerance - more dormant tissues more tolerant than young, fresh tissues
	- prevention:
		- angle to sun
		- coloration and reflectence
		- thick cuticles
		- leaf hairs - conductive cooling



### Acclimation
- development of tolerance to injury from high or low temperature
- cold-adapted and heat-adapted of same species have different tolerances, photosynthesis and respiration rates
	- reasons speculated:
		- low temp-acclimation from increased capacity of a limiting temperature-dependent catalytic step
			- also - protein thermostability from conformational changes and existing proteins and synthesis of proteins more resistant to low-temperature stress
			- also, decrease in osmotic portential as a result of sugar accumulation; increase in protein synthesis caused by increase in abcissic acid
		- high-temp acclimation from increased stability of one or several chloroplast components
