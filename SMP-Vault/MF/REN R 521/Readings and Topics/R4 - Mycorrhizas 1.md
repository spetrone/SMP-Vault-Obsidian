  Ectomycorrhizae - formed by "higher fungi" - in many families of Basidiomycetes and Ascomycetes
- example associations: pine, spruce, hemlock, oak, chestnut, walnut, beech, birch, eucalyptus, willow
- stimulated by root exudates
- hyphae - hair-like projections form mantle on root, separating it from surroundings
- secretes enzymes allowing root penetration into the cortex
- create Hartig nets - interconnected network around cells
- secretes growth regulating compounds, chaning root development
	- mycorrhizal roots are shorter, appear swollen, is branched, and does not form root hairs - the function of root hairs (nutrient uptake and water uptake) is assumed by mychorrizae/hyphae
- some require specific mycorrhizal associations in order to form sexual reproductive structures (sporocarps)
- many mushrooms found under trees are these fruiting bodies, including truffles

Endomycorrhizae - more common in land plants (90%)
- usually associated with herbaceous (non-woody) plants such as wheat, corn, tomatoes, onions, etc. along with some trees like apple and orange trees
- most common type - hyphae from germinating spores (sexual or asexual)
- Identity of fungi are not known, nor the mechanism of formation - classification is based on morphology
- Thought that they are "lower fungi" - class of Zygomycetes and all those known placed into one family - Endogonaceae
- nearly microscopic spores are common in soil - infect susceptible roots when environmental conditions are favorable - secrete enzyymes dissolving small portion of cell wall which permits hypahe to penetrate root hairs and other epidermal cells - sometimes limited to epidermis
- roots may look normal and would require a microscopic examination to see hyphal projections invaded into the interior of cells where they may remain as hyphal strands or form terminal hyphal swellings (cesicles) or highly branched hyphae (arbuscles) or coils == vesicular-arbuscular mycorrhizae

#### Ectendomycorrhizae
- found on trees that normally form ectomycorrhizae
	- characteristics of both ectomycorrhizae and endomycorrhizae
- detected more in nurseries
- mantly may be present or absent - if present thin alog with hyphae inside root cells
- might e a transitional stage between the two types


### Why are they important?
- phosophorus uptake
- establishment of plants on land
- enhanced productivity
- nutrient and water absorption
- root health and longevity
- tolerance to drought, high soil temps, toxic heavy metals, extremes in pH, transplant shock



What are some methods of measuring mycorrhyzal networks structure?

How significant are mycorrhizae in the water uptake by trees?

How are mycorrhizae responding to changing climates? Can they help trees adapt faster? On shorter time scales, are they involved in acclimation processes?


Is it scientifically proven that they transport metabolites between plants?
