- With response to pathogens, how does the oxidative burst fit with the CODIT model
- Are C4 plants more or less sensitive to oxidative stress compared to C3 plants?


- The most common ROS include 1O2, O2 •−, H2O2, •OH.
	- close to 3% of O2 escapes as ROSs
- OH - hydroxyl radical - long half-life - most reactive - two unpaired electrons = triplet ground state
	- cellular damages such as lipid peroxidation, protein damage, and membrane destruction [48].
- H202 can diffuse through aquaporins, most interesting for cell signalling and metabolic pathways
	- high concentrations, cell death or damage
	- half-life long
	- danger is being converted to more reactive species

- ROS are produced in both unstressed and stressed cells at several locations in chloroplasts, mitochondria, plasma membranes, peroxisomes, apoplast, endoplasmic reticulum, and cell walls
- formed by the inevitable leakage of electrons onto O2 from the electron transport activities of chloroplasts, mitochondria, and plasma membranes or as a byproduct of various metabolic pathways localized in different cellular compartments.


- choloroplasts: In case of overloading of the ETC, due to decreased NADP supply resulting from stress conditions, there is leakage of electron from ferredoxin to O2, reducing it to O2 •−
	- Leakage of electrons to O2 may also occur from 2Fe-2S and 4Fe-4S clusters in the ETC of PSI. In PSII, acceptor side of ETC contains QA and QB. Leakage of electron from this site to O2 contributes to the production of O2 •−
- Peroxisomes. Peroxisomes are probably the major sites of intracellular H2O2 production, as a result of their essentially oxidative type of metabolism
- Plasma Membranes. Electron transporting oxidoreductases are ubiquitous at plasma membranes and lead to generation of ROS at plasma membrane.
- . Apoplast. Cell-wall-located enzymes have been proved to be responsible for apoplastic ROS production




### Messengers
- Role of ROS as Messengers. At low/moderate concentration, ROS have been implicated as second messengers in intracellular signaling cascades that mediate several plant responses in plant cells, including stomatal closure [19, 20, 65], programmed cell death [7, 72], gravitropism [73], dormancy, and acquisition of tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses.
- ROS can also modulate the activities of many components in signaling, such as protein phosphatases, protein kinases and transcription factors
	- and communicate with other signal molecules and the pathway forming part of the signaling network that controls response downstream of ROS
- strength, lifetime and size of the ROS signaling pool depends on balance between oxidant production and removal by the antioxidant.
- Abiotic and biotic stresses:
	- pathogenisis signal transduction regulators - oxidative burst
	- induction of defense after wounding
	- lignin biosynthesis regulation between jasmonic acid and ROS
	- osmitic stress, low temp andd hevy metal signal transduction pathway

##### Stomatal Closure:
ROS are considered second messengers in the abscisic acid (ABA) transduction pathway in guard cells [19, 20]. ABA induced H2O2 is an essential signal in mediating stomatal closure to reduce water loss through the activation of calcium-permeable channels in the plasma membrane


### Oxidative Stress:
ust be strictly controlled in order to avoid oxidative stress. When the level of ROS exceeds the defense mechanisms, a cell is said to be in a state of “oxidative stress”. 

However, the equilibrium between production and scavenging of ROS is perturbed under a number of stressful conditions such as salinity, drought, high light, toxicity due to metals, pathogens, and so forth.

Enhanced level of ROS can cause damage to biomolecules such as lipids, proteins and DNA (Figure 4). These reactions can alter intrinsic membrane properties like fluidity, ion transport, loss of enzyme activity, protein cross-linking, inhibition of protein synthesis, DNA damage, and so forth ultimately resulting in cell death.

- Lipids. When ROS level reaches above threshold, enhanced lipid peroxidation takes place in both cellular and organellar membranes, which, in turn, affect normal cellular functioning.
- Proteins. The attack of ROS on proteins may cause modification of proteins in a variety of ways, some are direct and others indirect
- . DNA. ROS are a major source of DNA damage [102]. ROS can cause oxidative damages to nuclear, mitochondrial, and chloroplastic DNA.


### Antioxidative Defense System in Plants
- Nonenzymatic components of antioxidative defense system 
- ascorbate : most abundant, low molecular weight antioxidant
- Glutathione. Tripeptide glutathione (γ-glutamyl-cysteinyl-glycine, GSH) is one of the crucial low molecularweight nonprotein thiol that plays an important role inintracellular defense against ROS-induced oxidative damage.
- 3.1.3. Tocopherols (vitamin E). Tocopherols (α, β, γ, and δ) represent a group of lipophilic antioxidants involved in scavenging of oxygen free radicals, lipid peroxy radicals, and 1O2
- Carotenoids. Carotenoids also belong to the group of lipophilic antioxidants and are able to detoxify various forms of ROS
	- As an antioxidant, they scavenge 1O2 to inhibit oxidativedamage and quench triplet sensitizer (3Chl∗) and excitedchlorophyll (Chl∗) molecule to prevent the
	- formation of 1O2 to protect the photosynthetic apparatus. Carotenoids also serve as precursors to signaling molecules that influence plant development and biotic/abiotic stress responses
	- Phenolic Compounds. Phenolics are diverse secondary metabolites (flavonoids, tannins, hydroxycinnamate esters, and lignin) which possess antioxidant properties.
		-- anthocyanins as well
	- Enzymatic Components. The enzymatic components of the antioxidative defense system comprise of several antioxi-dant enzymes such as superoxide
	- Superoxide Dismutase. Superoxide dismutase (SOD, plays central role in defense against oxidative stress in all aerobic organisms
	- Catalase. Among antioxidant enzymes, catalase (CAT, was the first enzyme to be discovered and character-ized.
	- Guaiacol Peroxidase. Guaiacol peroxidase (GPX, EC, a heme containing protein, preferably oxidizes aro-matic electron donor such as guaiacol and pyragallol at the expense of H2O2.
	-  Enzymes of Ascorbate-Glutathione Cycle. The change in the ratio of AsA to DHA and GSH to GSSG is crucial for the cell to sense oxidative stress and respond accordingly. The AsA-GSH cycle also referred to as Halliwell-Asada pathway is the recycling pathway of AsA and GSH regeneration which also detoxifies H2O2.
		- Ascorbate Peroxidase.
		- Monodehydroascorbate Reductase.
		- Dehydroascorbate Reductase.
		- Glutathione Reductase (GR).

### Overproduction of ROS under Stressful Conditions
- However, in response to various envi-
ronmental stresses, ROS are drastically increased in plants

disturbing the normal balance of O2

•−, •OH, and H2O2 in
the intracellular environment [113]. The effects of various
environmental stresses such as drought, salinity, chilling,
metal toxicity, UV-B radiation, and pathogen attack on ROS
production are discussed below.


- **Drought.** Under drought stress, ROS production is en-
hanced in several ways
- . Inhibition of carbon dioxide (CO2 )assimilation,
- coupled with the changes in photosystem activ-ities and photosynthetic transport capacity under droughtstress results in accelerated production of ROS via the chloroplast Mehler reaction [237].
- During drought stress, CO2 fixation is limited due to stomatal closure which,in turn, leads to reduced NADP+ regeneration through the Calvin cycle. Due to lack of electron acceptor, over reduction of the photosynthetic ETC occurs which leads to a higher leakage of electrons to O2 by the Mehler reaction.
- Under drought stress, the photorespiratory pathway is also enhanced, especially, when RUBP oxygenation is maximal due to limitation in CO2 fixation [63]). Noctor and collaborators [63] have estimated that photorespiration is likely to account for over 70% of total H2O2 production under drought stress conditions.



- **Salinity. S**alinity stress results in an excessive generation of ROS [12, 242]. High salt concentrations lead to overproduction of the ROS- O2−, •OH, H2O2, and 1O2by:
	- impairment of the cellular electron transport within different subcellular compartments such as chloroplasts and mito-chondria, 
	- as well as from induction of metabolic pathways such as photorespiration. Salt stress can lead to
	- stomatal closure, which reduces CO2 availability in the leaves and inhibits carbon fixation which, in turn, causes
	- exposure of chloroplasts to excessive excitation energy and overreductionof photosynthetic electron transport system leading to enhanced generation of ROS and induced oxidative stress.


**Chilling**
Chilling. Chilling stress is a key environmental factor
limiting growth and productivity of crop plants. by:
- exacerbating imbalance between light absorption and light use by inhibiting Calvin-Benson cycle activity [249], enhancing photosynthetic electron flux to O2 and causing overreduction of respiratory ETC [9].
- Chilling stress also causes significant reductions in rbcL and rbcS transcripts, RUBISCO content and initial RUBISCO activity, leading to higher electronflux to O2 [250]. 


**Metal toxicity**
- Under metal stress condition, net photosynthesis (Phn) decreases due to damage
to photosynthetic metabolism, including photosynthetic electron transport


UV-B radiations
- [269]. Enhanced UV-B significantly inhibits net photosynthetic rate. It has been
 shown that UV-B treatment results in decrease in the light-saturated rate of CO2 assimilation, accompanied by decreases in carboxylation velocity and RUBISCO content and activity


Pathogens
- Pathogens. One of the earliest cellular responses following successful pathogen recognition is oxidative burst involving production of ROS. Recognition of a variety of pathogens leads to generation of O2


- plants can die due to an oxidative burst - so they may die after recovery from a stress - but really they are unable to recover because they have too much oxygen to handle; ROS kills the plant
	- e.g. flooding tolerance depends on two things:
		- flood tolerance (anaerobic root conditions)
		- ROS tolerance
