- **ray and axial paranchyma f**orm 3D lattice in radial and axial directions and provide a functional link between phloem and water transport system
- **.Symplast** is formed by plasma continuum through cell–cell connections via plasmodesmata within mainly simple pits and is interwoven among conductive tissues and fibres forming two kinds, ray and axial parenchyma
- 
- **. Dead parenchyma,** whose extractives (released during cell death) are responsible for the **dark coloration** in heartwood, together with heavily lignified fibres or tracheids (forming annual rings in temperate tree species), occluded vessels from tyloses (outgrowths from the protoplast of vessel-associated parenchyma cells) and suberized periderm, form the physical and biologically inactive defence.
- 
- CODIT : s a concept showing how trees are highly compartmented perennial organisms formed of discrete 3-D units that when under threat from any abiotic or biotic stress
- 
- r modern understanding of CODIT is that it encompasses the trees’ response to any desiccation-inducing threat, whether biotic or abiotic
- Although the concept was developed for the xylem alone, the model could be used effectively to explain all stress-related interferences within and beyond xylem
- According to the CODIT model, sapwood is made up of four protective boundary-setting conceptual walls, which range from weak to strong in ascending order. Walls 1–3 form discrete anatomical units that are constitutively formed, while wall 4, the ‘so-called’ barrier zone, is different in that it is produced after wounding, is usually enforced by suberin and is formed by the cambium or cambial derivatives
- Suberin is a complex of suberin polyphenolics (SPPs) and suberin polyaliphatics (SPAs) that are cross-linked by glycerol, embedded with soluble waxes and laminated to the interior side of the plant cell walls


WALLS
1. **Wall 1** is formed of tracheary elements (conductive cells of either angiosperms or conifers) and the adjacent living axial parenchyma contact cells that can plug vessels by tyloses or polyphenols
2. **Wall 2**: Wall 2 comprises the latewood of annual rings of temperate tree species, and ray parenchyma present intermittently along a growth ring
3. **Wall 3** describes ray parenchyma that inhibits lateral fungal spread, with ray units ranging in height and width from short, uniseriate to high, multiseriate rays
4. **wall 4** or the barrier zone is a region composed of usually multiple layers of enlarged ray and axial parenchyma cells (up to 30 cell layers wide; Pearce, 1996) that prevents fungal decay spread into new xylem laid down to the barrier zone’s exterior.

*All these conceptual walls are designed to be chemically bolstered by phytoalexins from ray and axial parenchyma in response to wounds to greater or lesser degrees*


## Immune System
 - two known branches forming the plant immune system: the first branch is non-specific and applies to a range of fungi, herbivores and mechanical wounds, while the second branch discriminates between general threats and virulent pathogen
- Defence 1: Secondary Metabolites (balanced with energy costs)
- Pattern-triggered immunity - jasmonic and salicylic acid pathways communicating to target pathgenic fungi
	- jasmonic acid kill parenchyma
	- salicylic acid triggers accumulation of hydrogen peroxide - causes programmed cell death
	- defence against biotrophs (fungi and haustoria)

### Response
- the close alignment of the living cells running vertically (axial parenchyma; CODIT walls 1 and 2) and radially (ray parenchyma; CODIT wall 3) and their intertwinement allows for the easy transfer of phytohormone signals from the immediate contact region of the pathogen

![[Pasted image 20250201220021.png]]
### Signalling and transport
- in angiosperms - endocytosis allowing apoplastic to symplastic transport from vessels to parenchyma
- gymnosperms are less connected symplastically but have other methods of defence(think tracheids with torus-margo pits vs. vessel elements with paranchyma)
	- torus-margo pits for embolism
	- resin canals surrounded by epithelial cells are specialized in defence against pathogens and general damage, and are a likely substitute for ‘typical’ axial parenchyma
	- . Conifers are mostly composed of unicellular ray parenchyma (rarely bicellular), where ‘typical’ axial parenchyma fractions are generally low and completely absent in some genera
	- **Oleoresin, a terpenoid SM** present in resin canals, provides various conifers with both mechanical and chemical defence (Smith et  al., 2016). The oleoresin terpenoids act as deterrents or are directly toxic to insects and pathogens, while the volatile components of oleoresin also act as airborne signalling molecules in recognition of the host by the bark beetles
	- Constitutive resin canals (or intercellular canals; IAWA Committee, 2004) in Picea spp., for example, are arranged in defensive bands across xylem, as seen in cross-section, and are surrounded by epithelial cells that synthesize resin, once triggered
		- banded arrangement of the canals, similar to marginal axial parenchyma in a range of angiosperm trees (Fig. 2C), probably form the constitutive element (wall 1 and 2 of CODIT), and are induced once living cells abutting the ducts are triggered into filling them with terpenoid SMs
		- Resin canals, when closed, can form a reaction zone (wall 1 and 2 of CODIT) that completely circumvents the sapwood in tangential and axial directions, which is similar in construct and alignment to the barrier zone (wall 4)
			- e former develops during wounding and the latter after wounding
		- Resin canals are positioned radially among ray parenchyma (called fusiform rays) in some conifers (Evert, 2006), forming wall 3 of CODIT and helping prevent lateral fungal spread.

### Reaction Zones
- **Reaction zones** form through programmed cell death at the interface between sound and decayed wood
	-   rows of dead parenchyma filled with antimicrobial polyphenolic compounds (phytoalexins) and are  often structurally reinforced with lignin and suberin (phytoalexins) prior to programmed cell death (Fig. 2A, B, D)
- Macroscopically, reaction zones mostly appear as dark brown necrotic regions that should not be confused with zone lines
- **Zone lines** are black on account of melanin accumulation and are produced by a number of fungal species in response to antagonism from another fungus, or from  another strain from the same fungal species and also in response to living cells along the reaction zone

- salicylic acid pathways not well documented in trees - may be too large - but there is some evidence
	- there are jasmonic acid pathways documented in trees
-  evidence of systemic induced resistance against necrotrophs is lacking in angiospersms, but some evidence in conifers
	- some studies show SM and reaction formation at large distances from site of infection; often with traumatic resin canales
	- Jasmonate-induced ethylene production was shown to be responsible for reprogramming of the vascular cambial zone for the formation of traumatic resin ducts in conifer stems
		- Concerning the composition of constitutive and induced resin, the latter is more monoterpene enriched (Martin et al., 2002) and thus less viscous, which facilitates resin flow in xylem.
		- So, although reaction zones are formed in response to wounding in general, there is a heightened response to fungal pathogens by some conifer
- Two kinds of reaction zones: static and dynamic
	- dynamic: successive zones formed at increasing distances from wond intro formerly healthy sapwood - related to a poor host respons and lack of polyphenolic compounds - as with many conifers
		- more common in those that react with investing in axial paranchyma, or radial and axial resin canals
	- static reaction zone - most angiosperms - a higher quality and quantity of SMs usually prevents any further progress of fungal spread
		- second static zone can be formed upon failure of the first
	- reaction zone limited by connectivity between living cells


- reaction zone vs barrier zone (wall 4) - reaction zones are not continuous, where gaps between axial and ray paranchyma can provide access points for fungi across xylem tissue
- TIMING
	- dormant trees often don't produce SMs and the walls are not as effective - only partially effective without SMs
- ROLES 
	- heartwood and bark - constitutive role in defence
	- sapwood and secondary phloem - based around having an integrated system of pre-formed and induced defences
	- primary role of 3D interconnected symplastic network is providing transport link between phloem and xylem - preserving integrity of hydraulic system and protecting cambium - SACRIFICED for defense purposes - death of paranchyma dn blocking of tracheary elements - tradeoff between conservation of xylem and phloem and hydraulic and storage space vs. compartmentalization of the decayed/diseased

## SECONDARY METABOLITES
#### Phytoalexins 
- heterogeneous group of antibiotics
- During the formation of reaction zones in sapwood, phytoalexin SMs are generally thought to be synthesized in large doses only in response to fungi and bacteria, while being found to accumulate to a lesser degree against abiotic stresses
	- classes:
		- terpenoids
		- alkaloids
		- lignans
		- glycosteroids
##### Phytoanticpins 
= pre-formed component of defence e.g in heartwood:
	- plyphenols
	- quinones
	- saponins
	- terpenoids
	- stilbenes
	- tannins

#### HEARTWOOD
- low in free O2, low moisture, high CO2, dead, durable - resistant to fungi
- at transition zone - ray paranchyma release antimicrobial SMs, phytoanticipins that accumulate in heartwood
	- The SMs released from ray and axial parenchyma at the transition zone include
		- (1) flavonoids
		- (2) quinones 
		- (3) stilbenes
		- (4) tannins 
- a balance between constitutive defences and induced defences may well depend on the nature of the threat and the frequency of attacks, as well as the ecological strategy (life history) of the tree species.
	- extended growth/differentiaton model (GDBe; Herms and Mattson, 1992) and
	- the protein competition model (PCM; Jones and Hartley, 1999).

### Wood - reaction zones
- Through exocytosis along the plasma membrane of parenchyma cells, polyphenols can be secreted from parenchyma cells through pit membranes into adjacent vessels or fibres as precursor molecules with subsequent polymerization within vessel and fibre lumina. However, we do not know precisely how polyphenols cross the plasmalemma, amorphous layer and pit membrane of cell walls at the parenchyma–vessel or parenchyma–tracheid pit membranes.
- lignification and suberin in reaction zones
	- the amount of suberin and lignin synthesized de novo may be related to the composition of the simple phenols produced in the cytoplasm
- . Regarding defence in angiosperm trees, the core function of the vessel-associated cells is their involvement in clogging the vessels to prevent longitudinal spread of fungal pathogens (wall 1 of CODIT) -> also causes dessication

### Tyloses and gels 
- When tyloses/gels (formed of cell wall content, lignin, suberin, phenolic compounds and pectins; De Micco et  al., 2016) are triggered into clogging the vessels either indirectly following embolism formation or directly in response to vascular pathogens from the vessel side, vessel-associated cells die (Fig. 2A). Tylosis development results in the death of vesselassociated cells together with the cessation of translocation in the affected vessels
- The mechanism triggering tyloses or gels (also known as gums) together with the composition of the substance probably depends on whether it is trauma or embolism induced. Trauma-induced gels have a high abundance of antimicrobial SMs from different chemical pathways including catechol, flavonoids and coumarins (Rioux et al., 1998; Del Rio et al., 2001; Baum and Schwarze, 2002), indicating that a different secondary metabolic pathway is possibly triggered in vesselassociated cells in response to pathogenesis (
- r, we do not know precisely how polyphenols cross the plasmalemma, amorphous layer and pit membrane of cell walls at the parenchyma–vessel or parenchyma–tracheid pit membranes
- narrow black stained layer inner walls, lignification and suberin in parenchyma and xylem depending on species
- could be suggested that phenol accumulation in parenchyma triggers suberin and lignin deposition in response to pathogenic decay fungi
- When tyloses/gels (formed of cell wall content, lignin, suberin, phenolic compounds and pectins; De Micco et  al., 2016) are triggered into clogging the vessels either indirectly following embolism formation or directly in response to vascular pathogens from the vessel side, vessel-associated cells die
	- sometimes vessel associated cells live sometimes they die
	- 
- The mechanism triggering tyloses or gels (also known as gums) together with the composition of the substance probably depends on whether it is trauma or embolism induced.
	- different secondary metabolic pathway is possibly triggered in vesselassociated cells in response to pathogenesis
	- Trauma-induced gels (i.e. polyphenols, pectin and hemicelluloses), compared with tyloses, can be secreted through smaller pit apertures than parenchyma–vessel pit membranes, **and may be complementary to tyloses** in the wider development of reaction zones. e gels can fill both fibres and vascular tracheids together with vessels
- In extant conifers, ray contact cells are not known to produce tyloses and clog tracheids. However, the epithelial cells that surround resin canals appear to completely clog intercellular resin canals in response to fungi by a similar process to tylosis, but intrusions in the case of conifers are referred as tylosoids
	- they do not pass through a pit cavity as found in parenchyma–vessel pit membranes in angiosperms
	- e blocking of resin canals in reaction zone formation prevents axial and radial spread of decay


### SM and Barrier Zone
- parenchyma of the barrier zone is filled with NSCs in the form of starch, which becomes mobilized and converted into polyphenolic SMs, while in many species lignin and suberin are induced in the cell walls, making the barrier zone both a chemical and an anatomical construct
- strength of the barrier zone varies between species and is largely genetically controlled
- the effectiveness of wall 4 of CODIT and the tree’s ability to synthesize phenolic-based SMs
- e timing of SM synthesis is also a critical factor determining the effectiveness of the barrier zone, which depends on the genetic propensity of the species, the fitness of the individual at the time of infection



### SM and Wood Decay Fungi
- No decay fungi are completely necrotrophic or saprotrophic, but fall somewhere along a gradient between them
	- stage-specific necrotrophy upon sapwood colonization, suggesting trade-offs between wood decay and parasitism
- three main types of fungal wood decay: 
	- brown rot
		- heartwood
		- weakly pathogenic
		- high stress tolerance, use heart rot strategy - release of small molecules of hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl radicals
		- or breaks down tannins - creates reddish brown colour
	- soft rot
		- sapwood
		- more pathogenic
	- white rot
		- sapwood
		- mor pathogenic
		- simultaneous white rots and 
		- selective delignification

### Beneficial Endophytes
- many have co-evolutionary relationship with trees beneficial to tree health by suppressing decay-causing fungi
- some without a close evolutionary coupling with host become pathogenic under the right conditions
- e.g. endophytic fungus Taxomyces andreanae produces SM paclitaxel (taxol) - antifungal diterpenoid
	- the endophyte, on recognition of the threat, migrates to pathogen entry points (cracks in the bark) where paclitazel is synthesized in extracellular hydrophobic bodies
	- e released by exocytosis upon contact with fungi
	- extracellular bodies coalesces to form a continuous barrier blocking the entrance way to the decay fungi.
- e.g. e Trichoderma spp., root symbionts that behave as mycoparasites while inducing systemic plant defences to protect the plant through the secretion of various SMs and proteins
	- Trichoderma uses SM compounds, volatile organic compounds, fungal toxic cell wall-degrading enzymes (chitinases and glucanases) and appressoria (clamp-like structures) to parasitize other fungi.
	- Other SMs associated with the antagonistic behaviour in Trichoderma include: terpenes, peptides, gliovirn, gliotoxin, pyrenes, siderophores and isocyane metabolites 
- Plant systemic resistance works through the manipulation of the SM hormones, jasmonic acid, salicylic acid and ethylene, by asymptomless endophytes (e.g. Trichoderma spp. and mycorrhizae).
	- how Trichoderma (or similar endophytes) activates the defence system in trees remains poorly understood
	- no known evidence to support salicylic acid signalling pathways in secondary xylem (


### Non-Beneficial Endophytes
- many stay in trees as chlamydospores until stressed then become pathogenics
- strategy used by the decay-causing ‘endophytes’ appears to be a ‘chink in the armour’ of the tree’s CODIT system
- e suggest that there is perhaps a specialized gelatinous layer surrounding the spore that makes it undetectable to parenchyma or that enzymes manipulate the defence signalling pathways (CODIT),

### Drought and Stress
- may become more vulnerable to various pathogens
- s pathogens during times of drought include opportunistic decay fungi such as the white rot complex Armillaria mellea, which in turn pave the way for secondary decay fungi (more saprotrophic).
- tree’s immune system is low, the CODIT system can be overwhelmed and easily breached, which can result in complete failure and tree death
- lies in the availability of NSC
- Starch reserves within the parenchyma of the secondary xylem are critical to offset the effects of short-term drought,
- , NSCs act as a buffer through osmotic adjustments (Sala et  al., 2012), but are also available for conversion to SMs for defence, as drought brings with it an increased risk of attack from pathogens.
- temperate tree species with more parenchyma and a greater capacity for NSC storage, particularly in storage cells of ray parenchyma (Chattaway, 1951), should have greater defence potential owing to subsequent abundant chemical availability
- In leaves, the onset of drought signals stress-related phytohormones and enzymes from the phenolic pathway to activate secondary metabolism from primary pathways, where fresh reserves of NSC are available to be converted to SMs
	- chlorenchyma of leaves (and bark of many species), the chloroplasts are specialist organelles involved in active defence against pathogens: as the first organelles to receive stress signals before shutting down photosynthesis, chloroplasts liaise with the cell membrane, endoplastic reticulum and nuclei to form an interorganellular immune response that is highly effective against pathogens
- post-drought hydraulic recovery is largely dependent on the upkeep of vessel-associated cells and vessel or tracheid translocation.
- when the hydraulic system falters, the defence system is activated.
- e integrity of the water conductive system against the ingress of air (embolism formation) is foremost to safeguard the tree, and all tree responses to fungal pathogens revolve around maintenance of the hydraulic system

NOTES
- **biotroph** - feed on live tissue
- **necrotroph** - kill host cells and extract nutrients
- **saprotroph** - feed on dead tissue
- Pattern-Triggered-Immunity (PTI) in trees - 
- there is a form of PTI not to be confused with induced systemic resistence triggered by beneficial microbes
-  microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP), microbe-triggered immunity (MTI) and effectortriggered immunity (ETI) described for herbaceous plants
- non-decay colonizers failed to induce discoloration (reaction zone formation) from living parenchyma, while decay fungi prompted strong discoloration (defence response) in excised live sapwood tissue. The latter work shows that trees can differentiate harmful from non-harmful fungi and respond accordingly,


### Discussion
- Conifers have very very thin rays
- Cedar vs. spruce or pine
	- cedar is more durable/resilient despite not having resin canals
	- spruce/pine/fire must be treated to preserve it
- note: less parenchyma in colder-temp trees vs. tropical; 
	- salix and poplar have very little parenchyma
- Aspen
	- no tyloses
	- very limited parenchyma


## Question
- can there be trans-membrane transport in the signaling/transport pathway?
