### Terminology
- **para-dormancy**: growth suppression imposed on particular organs by other tree structures (e.g. apical dominance) due to the production and/or action of inhibitory molecules
- **endo-dormancy**: when growth is not possible even under suitable temperature conditions, as buds have not received sufficient exposure to chilling
- **Eco-dormancy** : subsequent period where buds need only sufficient exposure to warm temperatures to resume growth

- various omics data shows that is is not a null state - there is dormancy-related activity

Control:
- epigenetic mechanisms modifying gene expression patterns for domancy release in fruit trees
- reactive oxygen species 9ROS) associated with cellular stress proposed as key molecules integrating env. cues and metabolic processes regulating plant growthand env.

## Seasonal Framework of Dormancy
- winter dormancy in woody perennials is one of the phases of the plants' seasonal cycle
	- temporary suspension of visible growth
	- 3 Phases (ignoring para dormancy and focusing on winter dormancy processes)
	a.  dormancy induction
		- leaf fall
	b. endo-dormancy ("true dormancy" or "rest")
		- no meristem growth even under good conditions
    c. eco-dormancy (aka "climatic dormancy", "quiescence")
	    - controlled by external factors, progressively responsive to favorable conditions
... then: eco-dormancy release and growth resumption --> observation of the first phenological changes that lead to bud burst an bloom in response to favorable temperature conditions

* note: regulation of phase transitions during dormancy process by environmental conditions such as photo-period and temperature is highly species-specific - e.g. high and low chill species

#### 1. Dormancy Induction
- buds set, growth is suspended, leaves lose their green colour and drop
- temperature and photoperiod contribute to dormancy induction in many species
	- photoperiod - time of year - intensity changes with latitude
		- causes decreases and increases in temperature from solar radiation input
	- photoperiod patterns quite predictable, but temperature swings with climate variations
	- relative importance of temperature and photoperiod in establishment of dormancy depend son species and cultivar
		- e.g. critically short photoperiod for yellow popular
		- e.g. many fruit trees require only low nighttime temperatures
		- other species - interaction of photoperiod and temperature; same conditions may have different effects on dormancy induction in different species
- progressive and determining exact moment of dormancy onset is difficult - leaf fall a good reference
- **bud set:** implies the initiation of scale leaves that protect the embryonic shoot - end of summer and in early autumn
- flower primordia development is at different stages when suspended 

#### 2. Endo-Dormancy
- controlled by plant-endogenous factors
- characterized by: inability to grow even under favorable environmental conditions
- exposure to chilling is required for a certain period to overcome this state of rest and recover the bud's responsiveness to growth-promoting environmental signals
	- prevents bug burst during temporary spells of mild temperatures during the cold season
- sensitive parts of tree remain protected inside bud (vegetative and reproductive meristems)
	- flower primordia present all verticiles differentiated and clearly distinguishable (petals, sepals, anthers, pistil)
- modeled with temperature-based models to quanitfy exposure to effective cold temps needed to overcome endo-dormancy & to predict bloom dates - rough mathematical approximations - no known biological or physiological parameters
	- Chilling Hours model - no rigorous scientific procedure
	- Utah model - weighted function for different temp. intervals
	- Dynamic model - process-based dormancy model - assumed low temps stimulated precursor compound in need ov conversion to permanent chill portion at moderate temperatures
	- forestry studies on phenology preduction - new advances - account for relationship between photoperiod and temp, or allow the quantification of interaction of physiologyical and environmental factors in addition to consiering them separately

#### 3. Eco-Dormancy
- after experience enough chill, endo-dormancy is overcome - buds recover capacity to grow but don't start immediately
- acclimated (freezing tolerant) but not deeply dormant - growht prevented by unsuitable environmental conditions
- temperature appears to be the main environmental driver
- mild temps lead to de-acclimation triggering resumption of growth
	- may require heat exposure to buds to reach certain phenological stages
	- mathematical models for heat that correlate temperatures with the transitions from a given phenological stage to the next one
- Growing Degree Hours (GDH) quantifies temperatres that are suitable for growth using parameters for base, optimum, and critical temperature thresholds for growth
	- fore trees combined with chill models to predict lboom dates
	- complicated because to phenological trait distinguishing eco-dormancy from endo-dormancy - not visible
- de-acclimation occurs within bud prior to bud burst + changes inside buds, especially for reproductive buds - pollen formation, meiosis, etc. - unlike evergreen species these processes rely on stored reserves from the previous growing season

## Physiological Processes that Regulate Dormancy
### 1. Transport
- during dormancy, transport of water and solutes stops both at the whole-plant level and at the cellular level within the meristems
- in spring, the xylem facilitates sufficient water supply to allow flower and leaf expansion
- phloem connects various plant organs and transports photosynthates and provides a signaling pathway
	- in shoot apical meristem, plasmodesmata allow cell-to-cell transportof molecules
	- plasmodesmata located in the sieve plates of the phloem as well as in the meristems play a major role in the orchestration of plant growth and development

### 2. Phytohormones
- mediate responses to biotic and abiotic stressors
- short and long distance signalling
- internal drivers that regulate phenology according to environment and seasonal variability 
- e.g. abscisic acid, giberellic acid, auxin, cytokins, jasmonic acid involved in phase transitions of bud dormancy

### 3. Genetic and Epigenetic Dormancy Regulation
- Genes: DAM (Dormancy-Associated MADS-box) genes, SVP (Short Vegetative Phase) genes, FT (flowering locus) genes, 
- transcriptomics - shown a broad range of structural and physiological functions during dormancy progression
- epigenetics: involved in environmental-molecular control of bud dormancy in perennials
	- modify histones altering gene expression patterns - i.e. change phenotype but not genotype
	- levels and patterns of DNA methylation and histone acetylation suggest a role for chromatin remodeling in coordinating global changes in gene expression during growth-dormancy cycles

### 4. Carbohydtrates
- *nonstructural* carbohydrate dynamics have roles in tree dormancy.
- soluble sugar synthesis and degredation rate
	- energy storage, transport, supply + osmotig regulation and signaling - vary by season
- reactive oxygen species produced in metabolic pathways -these products work as signaling compounds that mediate plant responses to abiotic and biotic stresses + function sin plant growth and evelopment
	- react with phytohormonal networks affecting basic cellular processes (e.g. cell cycle)

## Physiology of Dormancy Stages


### 1. Physiology Processes during Dormancy Induction 
- cessation of growth and establishment of dormancy
- phytochromes in leaves detect changes in levels of red and far-red light - trigger downregulation of genes (CO, FT)
	- CO protein loses stability - decrease FT expression, downregulate giberellin synthesis ---> trigger BUD FORMATION with FT moving through phloem towards apex forming scale (FT= flowering locus) (Populus model species)
- moderately low temperatures - dormancy established, cold acclimation
	- membrane proteins and fluidity act as empterature sensing system - get more rigid
	- activates Ca channels - increased inside cell
	- possibly depolymerization of microtubules and microfilaments
	- changes enzymatic rates  + enzymes and structural proteins unfold - shifts metabolic pools and redox status
- callose deposition in plasmodesmata - blocks cell-to-cell communication in shoot apical meristem
	- plugs sieve plates interrupting sap flow in response to CK vs auxin content
- xylem flow stops- leaves no longer transpiring - may cavitate from air bubbles from freeze/thaw
- phytohormones: increases abscisic acid  (ABA)(interrupts intercellular communiccation, suspens cell cycle inhibiting replication at G1 stage, may affect DAM signaling pathway), decreasing gibberellins (may be antagonized by ABA)
	- ABA/GA ration correlated with depth of dormancy in sweet cherry
- genes: DAM expression + upregulation of genes related to epigenetic regulation
- when leaves fall - N re-obilized and transported and stored in organs - roots and stems - reserves max just before fall
- twigs store starch


### 2. Physiological Processes during Endo-Dormancy
- have not elucidated chilling perception in perennial woody plants - structures or mechanisms to "accumulate" the signal ("winter chill accumulation")
	- processes revealed: restoration of symplastic field by cell-to-cell communication in the shoot apical meristem, expression of DAM genes, startch accumulation in shoot apical meristems
	- each chill triggers callose degredation increasing cell-to-cell accumulation
	- chills increase GH17 proteins - degredation of callose in plasmodesmata
		- calloses remain in callose plugs in phloem and air bubbles and cavitation prevent flow in xylem
	- phytohormons:
		- in-situ synthesis of ABA levels maintain dormancy until reduce to below threshold to release dormancy
		- bud-breaking chemicals act via activation of ABA catabolism
		- GA increased toward end of dormancy - regulated by GA-synthetic genes - catabolism of GA in induction and maintenance of bud dormancy
	- genes:
		- DAM genes expression pattern high and progressively repressed with chilling temps
		- some recent studies show involvement of eipgenetic mechanisms in environmental control of DAM gene expression in bud endo-dormancy release
	- reserves: max during endo-dormancy establishment - buds and storage organs like twigs
		- high sugar in cytoplasm and ABA-mediated rise in dehydrin prevent freezing injuries - osmotic regulation
			- maintain low rate plant metabolism
		- starch progressively accumulates in ovary with repeated chilling
		- carbohydrate metabolism with chilling --> increase oxidative stress (reacitve oxygen species by gluconeogenesis or oxidative phosphorylation) - lead to endo-dormancy release
		- abscense of cellular communication (callosed plasmodesmata) - oxygen deprivation in meristem cells - increase glycolysis and thanolic fermentation increasing reactive ocygen speceis
### 3. Physiologyical Processes during Eco-Dormancy
- buds progressively regain their capacity to grow - until completely resotred but growth not resumed until end of phase
	- no direct morphological or developmental changes
- pathways:
	- re-opening of symplastic communication in apical meristem and phloem
	- ovary primordia filled with starch for new growth and development
	- whole-plant communication restored with removal of plygs from sieve plates + sap flow resumes + allows transport of regulators like growth regulators to the buds
	- restoration of hydraulic transport capacity in xylem depending on starch in surrounding cells - embolism repair is osmotically driven and supported by degredation of starch into soluble sugars -- sugars transported accross membranes to create a gradient to drive water movement (therefore less startch, more sugar in total)
- phytohormons
	- increased auxin, giberellin
	- ABA concentrations drop
- genes: 
	- high expression of short vegetative phase (SVP) genes - growth inhibitors to prevent premature growth before bud break (fruits)
- carbohydrates:
	- starch in ovary - depletes for ovary growth and meiosis, starts to build up in stamen only during endodormancy
