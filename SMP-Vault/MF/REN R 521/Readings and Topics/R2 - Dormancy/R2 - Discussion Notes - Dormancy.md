# Deciduous Tree Dormancy 

- plants have photoreceptors - like phytochromes
- plants also have thermoreceptors (proteins) but these are not well-studied 

- no growth without water - water must push on cell wall 
	- cannot add water because they cannot add more water inside the cells

- there can be freezing tolerance without dormancy but not to the same extent - it is dangerous - you need a process to completely inhibit growth to prevent water from going into cells which will freeze
	- needed for long-term cold-hardiness
	- to not grow when temperatures can fluctuate up and down

- photo-period and low temperature
- photoperiod is usually the number one factor
	- can potentially be little bit delayed by nutrition, soil moisture content, nitrogen (e.g. oversupply), by delay of onset of low temperatures
-  e.g. some species respond more strongly to photoperiod
- pine does not develop endo-dormancy without both photoperiod and low temperatures
- spruce trees can enter endo-dormancy with just photoperiod
- can trees enter dormancy without photoperiod?
	- some of them potentially, but not normal to them

- old trees are harder to wake up

- environmental stresses can help induce dormancy

- research suggesting that physiologyically significant amounts of water can enter through the needles of conifers

- sources of water:
	- snow melt
	- soil (roots) - for big trees, this is necessary
	- from needles

- without leaves and transpiration pulling water - how does water get pulled up the tree?
