how they increase nutrient uptake:
- increase absorbing SA
- mobilize sparingly available nutrient sources
- excrete chelating compounds or ectoenzymes
- protect roots from soil pathogens - increasing root growth and nutrient acquisition of host


Competition for photosynthates favors a higher shoot:root ratio in mycorrhizal plants
- VAM are obligatorily dependent on host plant carbon for their sources of energy - must be measured in association with host plant

-  growth of both partners is influenced by
	- the host plant genotype
	- VAM species
	- ecotype
	- soil
	- *not necessarily related to soil fertility or percentage of root infection*



#### Physiology of Mycorrhizal Associations
- correlation between root colonization and active hyphae within the roots or those attached to the root surface
	- however, external hyphal length differs between VAM species
		- not well correlated with infected root length
	- **implications?*** - more correlated with environment - helps trees respond to environmental variables?

- fungle mantle and Hartig nets vary greatly in thickness and degree of formation
- 10-20% of net photosynthates required for formation, maintenance and function of mycorrhizal structures
- much variability in infection level, nutrient uptake, exchange interfaces, extension, viability, transport capacity of the external hyphae
	- activity may vary by distance from roof surface and time after infection
	- variation with mantles and hartig nets 
- some mycelial cords and non-living hyphae can also transport water and nutrients over long distances
- P acquisition by external hyphae mechanism:
	- formation of plyphosphates in hyphae - low internal phosphate concentration
	- small hyphal diameter leading to a relatively larger soil volume delivering P per unit surface area compared to the root surface area
		- 2-6x higher P influx rate per unit length of hyphae
	- production of extracellular acid phosphatases which catalyse the release of P from organic complexes
		- well-established for ECM/EM but not so much for VAM

### Root Zones
apical zones
	- ECM - fully-encapsulated (e.g. Norway Spruce) to 40-50% (Eucaplyptus)
	- VAM - free of fungal structures and not affected by their uptake capacity


## Nutrients
- legumes only - evidence scarce for non-legumes for benefits to N uptake
- most growth enhancement related to increases in P absorption - since P resources are sparingly soluble
	- even with restricted root growth - up to 80% of P can be delivered via external VAM over more than 10cm
	- ECM may extend much farther than VAM
	- Mycelial strand may transport P over large distances of several metres
- ECM and EM - Produce acid phosphates and phytase as ectoenzymes
- VAM - evidence lacking for extracellular phytase activity and acid phosphatase

- Obtaining nutrients from sources not available to non-mycorrhizal plants - ECM may release large amounts of oxalic acid - in calcareous soils, may mobilize P from Ca phosphates and prevent excessive Ca uptake by forming Ca oxalate in fungal-soil interface


- P nutrition depends on:
	- extent of P deficiency
	- soil and plant factors -e.g. growth rate
	- acid phosphatase activity
	- oganic acide secretion
	- P status of soil

- generally P concentrations and therefore utilizations lower  in mycorrhizal plants - other limiting factors - feedback loops in nutrient cycling in plant may be less well-regulated

- Depression of VAM and ECM infection levels by high soil P is often observed. The degree of depression not only depends on the fungal species but also on the level of N supply (p.93)
	- implications - fertilizers can damage symbiotic relationships - long term

## Nitrogen

### 1. VAM
- may increase N fixation in lower P soils where VAM associations are stronger (dependent to get P)
- more VAM - more nodulation, N2 fixation, and growth
- High carbon costs - from competition of photosynthates - for N2
- existence of extra-radical hyphal bridges between individuals permits transfer of nutrients
	- also true in mixed stands e.g. soybean to maize - transfer of N
		- only when mineral N (NH4NO3) but not when relying on N2 fixation due to the high cost of sugars
		- do not permit movement of N to non-legumes, only permit transfer between species with mineral
- seen as preferential to uptake NH4-N in hyphal compartment 
- hyphal transport of N occurs between individual plants, and e.g. Nursery effect (?proven?)
	- may impact nutrient cycling between species that share the same VAM along with competition
### 2. ECM/EM
- can utilize organic N sources through the production of extracellular acid proteinaises
- can provide host plants with access to N sources not normally available to non-mycorrhizal roots
- important where most N is in organic forms such as eucalypt, conifer forestss, and peat bogs

VAM dominate in P limited forests, ECM and EM dominate in N limited forests


### Mechanisms
- Mycorrhizas can enhance the inflow of N into root tips but not universally observed for ECM because of experimental constaints
- Ammonia is rapidly assimilated in the extramatrical hyphae - N then transferred to host as glutamine

## Other Macro-nutrients
- not much known
- VAM results show effects of infection on concentrations and amounts of K in shoots - but inconsistent and difficult to interpret
- high mobility of Ca and SO4 - unliely that hyphae are used/needed in most circumstances - may e different for ericaceous plants growing on acid peat soils, low in Ca

### Micronutrients
- numerous reports on the enhancement of Sn and Cu uptake by VAM infection
	- can be attibuted to external hyphaw to the host plant
- ECM/EM
	- few reports on role in micronutrient uptake when supply in soil is low or growth limiting
# Questions
Confused - p. 91: "Except where the mantle is diffuse, most nutrients delivered to the Hartig net are likely to be transported through the living external hyphae"

How does the competition for photosynthates affect/limit N2 fixation?

By what mechanism(s) do nutrients get transported via hyphae?

Is the possible lack of regulation of feedback loops with other nutrients (p.93) something that may improve with co-evolution of the symbiotic plants and fungi, or is it a result of the mycorrhizae acting as generalists when they infect multiple species?

Do exclusively associated symbiotic plants and fungi have better feedback loops? (e.g. Tamarack and Suillus spectabilis).
