Q1) Physiologically, can acclimation or stress responses to high temperatures negatively impact a tree's ability to acclimatize to cold temperatures afterwards - i.e. are there any long-term memory or permanent effects that negatively interact with other acclimation mechanisms (reference to Marchand et al. 2005, 2006)
	e.g.  Rubisco sensitivity may change with thermal history (Cavanagh and Kubein 2014)
	- given that t Tc was high for all species and increased with acclimation temperature, suggesting that the capacity of PSII to resist thermal stress was not very different among species from boreal and temperate regions (Fig. 3) - how could high temps affect cold-climate spacies?
		- however one experiment showed that Tc was higher in winter!
	- e.g. could an increase in heat shock proteins (HSP) affect cold tolerance
		- e.g. desaturated membrane lipids - more thermally stable thylakoid membrane - would this increase the temperature for the phase transition in cold temperatures?

Q2) If Photosystem II is negatively impacted by extreme heat, why is it not a target for genetic selection, given it is key to the process of photosynthesis? Why instead target Rubisco activity and HSP expression? Are they being selected first because their functions and/or associated acclimations are more limiting than those of PSII? Are there existing, adequate acclimations that maintain the function of PSII?

Q3) There is genetic variation along climate gradients. There is developing interest in exploiting that variation for "genetic improvement", using genetic selection, to "improve" tolerance to changing conditions, with a focus on warming conditions. However, is climate change simply causing a geographical shift of climate gradients? What could go wrong with this attempt to "rapidly engineer" evolution along a single gradient given the other extremes, such as extreme cold, that may not have been at play over evolutionary timelines in those climate gradients?

Q4) Why would saplings not be able to form new leaves (neo-formed leaves) after a heat event?


- +12 heat wave reduced growth in Pinus Taeda and Quercus rubra seedlings but not +6
- another study found it reduced photosynthesis and growth
- in Salix Arrctica - two consecutive 10d +8 heat wave initially increased growth but then it decreased

- impacts molecular level to the whole tree, vary among species and within genotypes

- drought and high light typically increase the damage caused by high temperatures


### Effects of High Temperatures 
- many physiological processes in trees are affected by excessive heat:
	- photosynthesis
	- respiration
	- transpiration
	- photorespiration
	- volatile organic compound production (VOC)

- whole-tree-level effects of heat:
	- reduced growth
	- reduced leaf development
	- reduced leaf area

### Photosynthesis and Respiration
- optimum temperaure in all species 20C-30C
	- still possible to 35C in many species with ambient CO2, and higher (40C) in some tropical species.
- Causes of decline in net photosynthesis:
	- increased photorespiration
		- from changes in Rubisco specificity + differences in CO2 and O2 solubility
		- suggestions that it may change with thermal history (Cavanagh and Kubein 2014)
	- increased mitochondrial respiration (dark respiration)
		- has higher temperature optimum
		- increases rapidly with temperature; rate depends on species, previous exposure, time of year, etc.
		- reduces net carbon gain at high temperatures
		- causes rapid consumption of carbohydrates for maintenance R
	- inactivation of Rubisco due to reduced activity of Rubisco activase
		- moderately high temperatures - primary constraint at those temperatures
	- decreased activity of photosystem II
		- moderate heating stimulates dephosphorylation of numerous PSII core proteins
		- damage usually only over 45C; foliar damage at lower temperatures usually is with high light; Damage below 40C is usually reversible
		- the critical temperature for PSII stability (Tc) is very sensitive to prior
		- temperature exposure
			- -higher prior exposure == higher critical temperature for PSII stability
		- Factors in addition to temperature, such as dormancy or phenology, must also influence Tc, because Tc of field-grown Eucalyptus pauciflora was 46 °C in summer and 60 °C in winter (O’Sullivan et al. 2012). This result indicates the need for additional research on the underlying causes of seasonal variation in Tc as it is not clear why Tc was substantially higher in winter than in summer in that study.
		- Tc was high for all species and increased with acclimation temperature, suggesting that the capacity of PSII to resist thermal stress was not very different among species from boreal and temperate regions (Fig. 3)
	- damage to the thlakoid membrane - less ATP aynthesis, increased permeability to H+ ions, increased fluitidy
		- at higher temperatures
		- reduce photosynthetic potential bey increasing thylakoid proton conductance creating greate cyclic electron flow around photosystem I


### Foliar Damage from Exposure to High Temperatures
- visible foliar damage from heat depends on species, duration of exposure and time of year.
	- as low as 44C for 180 min in boreal species; 
	- negative exponential relationship between temperature and duration of heat exposure leading to foliar damage
		- needle blanching on 40% of plants
		-  at just 2C higher (46C) 100% suffered  needle blanchingafter only 60 min
		- 50C, 100% damaged after 10 min
- temperature causing 50% leaf damage ranges from 47 to 50 in an experiment where it was linearly correlated with the average maximum temperature of the hottest month at the origin of seed collection
	- LT50 higher than maximum recorded temperature (but LT50 duration was short at 30 mins)
- no relationship determined between species origin and ability to tolerate high temperatures without damage
- timing of exposure is critical
	- during bud burst and leaf-out in the spring, lower (high) temps can cause substantial damage
		- It is generally considered that an increase of 10–15 °C above ambient will produce heat shock or heat stress (Wahid et al. 2007), but in A. saccharum trees during budburst, an elevation of only 8 °C produced significant and long-lasting detrimental effects
	- can cause mortality of emerging leaves ranging from 40% in upper canopy to 21% in lower canopy resulting in 65% reduction in end-of-season cumulative leaf area index
		- surviving pre-formed and neo-formed leaves had 36% reduction in photosynthetic capacity in early July compared to other years but recovered by late July and early August - overall less carbon gain as a result
	- saplings had few if none neo-formed (new) leaves after the heat event
		- indicating that there are ontogenetic differences in the capacity to recover from heat stress

## Heat Stress and Growth
- heat in waves rather than spread out as change in average temperature has more significant impact on growth;
		- can be long-lasting for perennials and can cause a reduction in growth in subsequent years
- can affect timing of budburst and dormancy, and therefor length of growing season
	- higher temperatures may activate budburst - activate pentose phosphate pathway
		- sustained exposure to unseasonably high temperatures during dormancy significantly delayed budburst in 3 species
	- duration is important
	- timing is important  - even for effects in the next season

### Tolerance and Avoidance of Thermal Stress
- prior exposure to moderately high temperatures - may confer tolerance
	- likely from synthesis of heat shock proteins
- some evidence of abscisic acid, ethylene, hydrogen peroxide, and salicylic acid in increasing tolerance to heat stress to short or sub-lethal high temperatures or gradual increase to lethally high temperatures
- thermal tolerance of photosynthesis:
	- Maximal PSII chemical efficiency increases for preconditioned plants
- membrane - HSPs can desaturate membrane lipids making them more thermally stable membranes
- reports of inhibition of Rubisco activase

###### Transpirational Cooling - avoidance
- most of the time if photosynthesis is reduced, CO2 builds up and stomata close (and decreased stomatal conductance)
	-  in some species doe they remain open (high stomatal conductance) when photosynthesis reduced and vapour pressure deficit - seems to be for transpirational cooling of the leaf
		- seems to reduce stem temperature by heat convection in rapidly moving water by as much as 30C
	- may be related to early successional species adapted to survive boundary-layer temperatures just above soil exposed directly to sunlight

#### Elevation - CO2 - mitigating effect
- higher CO2 concentrations at higher elevations increase optimum photosynthesis temperature
- plants at higher elevations seem to have less reduction of photosynthesis during heatwaves and after (recover faster) than plants at lower elevations
- However elevated CO2 induces stomatal closure in many species like many broadleaf deciduous trees - may cause carbon gain but exacerbate heat stress by reducing foliar transpiration

##### VOC - Avoidance
- isoprene, monoterpenes (two isoprenes combined as cyclic compound)
- isoprene 
	- may help stabilize photosynthesis complexes in thylakoid membrane - membrane stability 
	- may confer high-temperature tolerance through an antioxidative role
	- emitted immediately after production
- monoterpenes and other VOCs - stored in cells and released when exposure to high temps induces lipid damage

## Reactive oxygen species - LOSs

##### Heat and Drought
- at high temperatures, drought impedes the capacity to cool tissues to temperatures below the damage threshold via transpiration
- extreme temperatures translate into atmospheric drought, which in turn causes increased transpiration
- while exposed to both dry soil and a dry atmosphere caused by extreme temperatures, trees must maintain hydration to avoid a whole-system transport failure, which would ultimately lead to tree death
- both together creates positive feedback loop
	- no cloud - higher VPD - more transpiration - drier soil - less moisture for clouds
- RESPONSE - DECREASE TRANSPIRATION
- stomatal closure from increased CO2 in leaves - from biochemical limitation
- increase in carotenoids to for photooxidative protection at the expense of growth
	- reported that most species had decreased chlorophyll, ascorbate, and chlorophyll fluorescence (Fv/Fm) and increased tocopherol and xanthophyll cycle pigments, which would increase p
- down regulatio nof PSII
- increase in dissipation of electrons through alternative pathways
- early senescence of leaves - to reduce load on hydraulic system via transpiration or as a result of heat damage?
- may induce similar cellular damage and secondary stresses, such as osmotic and oxidative stress, which often activate similar cell signalling pathways and cellular responses, such as the production of stress proteins, up-regulation of antioxidants, and accumulation of compatible solutes


##### Genetics
- usually trade off between stress tolerance and productivity
- *."Looking for these types of responses among genotypes, especially in genotypes from the warmest portion of a species range where the growing season is extended, may be critical to selecting families and clones for superior performance under the heat and drought conditions that are expected to increase globally in the future."*
