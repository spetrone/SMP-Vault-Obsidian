Hydraulic lift (HL) or hydraulic redistribution (HR) processes are one of these strategies found in soil–plant systems, but their effects on crop production and the environment have not been well documented. This article reviews
(1) the process of HL,
(2) methods showing evidence of HL using soil water potential (Ws) and sap flow techniques, 
(3) hydraulically-lifting plants, and
(4) practical implications for society.

## WHAT
- When the SWC is lower than optimal, plants will not be capable of withdrawing water from the soil fast enough in response to potential evapotranspiration.

- Soil water extracted by plant roots, is transformed into transpiration
	- In general, transpiration is the transport of water from the roots to the substomatal cells of leaves.
	- Then, the liquid phase changes to the gaseous phase (water vapor) and is transported from substomatal cells to the atmosphere following a decreasing water potential gradient (creating a lower osmotic potential in the leaf)

- This stored water will be lost from the plant leaves and back to the atmosphere through the stomata (Liste and White 2008). Some of the water stored in the living plants is released from the root system into the soil at night by a phenomenon known as ‘‘hydraulic lift (HL) or hydraulic redistribution (HR)’’
- e HL usually occurs at night when transpiration has diminished sufficiently to allow the water potential in the roots to exceed the Ws in the drier portions of the soil
	- water movement from plant roots into the soil where Ws is lower
- transfer of water via roots from the moist and deeper soil layers to relatively drier upper soil layers is termed as ‘‘Hydraulic lift’’
- opportunity for parasitism of the released water to roots of neighboring plants

- plant roots commonly pass through dry soil layers to layers that contain more moisture. 

- In general, Ws is often more negative in the drier soil layers than the root water potential
	- . If water is lost from plant roots to drier soil, the root systems can form a bridge for water transport between soil layers


## WHERE
e HL has been observed in many natural treegrass mixtures and ecosystems



### EXAMPLES
- e field plots of interspersed sagebrush (Artemisia tridentata ssp. vaseyana (Rydb.) Beetle) and tussock grasses (Agropyron desertorum and Agropyron spicatum) that the water was absorbed and transported at night from moist to drier upper soil layers by deeper roots of these plant species.
- Using a sugar maple (Acer Saccharum), Dawson (1993, 1996) found that greater aboveground growth occurred under plants that utilized a high amount of hydraulic-lifted water with significantly higher leaf water potentials as compared with another neighboring plant that used little or no hydraulically-lifted water
- apparent relationships which were found between leaf water potential and xylem sap isotopic composition, and these relationships confirmed the critical effect of the redistribution of groundwater in the Cork-oak tree (Quercus suber L.).



## PROCESS OF HL

- water is absorbed by plants from all depths (soil layers) in which soil moisture is available, and this water passes into the transpiration stream through living plants during the day.
- At night when whole-plant transpiration is reduced (due to stomata being closed), and plant water potential rises;
- water moves from moist soil through the root system to drier soil layers. 
- Movement of water during nighttime depends on a passive mechanism driven by a water potential gradient that transports water through the root system, from the deep moist to the upper drier soil layers
	- plant transpiration draws water inflow from the soil through stems and to the atmosphere through stomata during the daytime
	- when stomata are closed during periods of reduced plant transpiration which occurs during the night, plant water potential equilibrates with the soil water potential.
	- s effect can cause water transport due to the water potential gradient between active plant roots and the drier soil resulting in water flow to drier soil

	- soil water content
	- soil water potential
		- matric potential
		- osmotic potential
	- root water potential
	- water potential gradient
	- positive vs. negative flow


### HL Plants
key points

QUestions
- scenarios
	- e.g. coarse layer

- can water be moved from an upper layer to a lower layer?
- How can mycorrhizae play a role in HL?
- How is this relevant to forestry?
	- mixewood 
	- age diversity & continuous cover



## Talking Points
- Reverse HL p.648
- HR rather than HL
- - when measuring sapflow with the heat method - more precise understanding of the direction of flow within the plant vs. a change in distribution in the soil
- - TREE size - implications - even aged stands
