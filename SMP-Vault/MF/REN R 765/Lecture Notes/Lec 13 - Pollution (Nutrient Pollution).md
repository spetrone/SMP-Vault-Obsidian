- many kinds of pollution, but nutrient pollution is more complex and significant driver of biodiversity los

# Part A: Nutrient Pollution as an Increasing Threat to Biodiversity  
1. Identify the forms of biologically reactive nitrogen and phosphorous, and which  
form of reactive nitrogen is the most mobile.  

- No3- most used by plants for growth and development
	- form most easilty lost to ground water (woil can't retain anions)
- NH4+ (ammonium) can be used by plants to make proteins directly
		Ammonification (saprobiotic bacteria): N2 -> NH3
		Nitritification (nitifying bacteria): NH3 -> NO2-
		Nitrification (nitrifying bacteria) : NO2- -> NO3-

- can volatilize to NOx gases
	- can react to form ozone
	- can react with methane
	- can alter cycling of methane in wetlands

Phosphorus: 
- Soluble P is phosphates: H2PO4-, HPO42-
	- most comes from weathering primary (parent) materials

1. Explain how human activity has changed the global N and P cycles, including the  
magnitudes of change and the timeframe.  

8-fold increase in Nitrogen fertilizer, much  (50%) is immediately lost to environment
3-fold increase in Phosphorus fertilizer
- These changes are mirrored by P concentrations in soils, which can serve as an  
indicator of eutrophication potential for freshwater lakes and phosphorous-sensitive  
estuarie

- have now added nearly as much as the total range of terrestrial bacterial nitrogen fixation (except agroecosystems)/as natural systems combined 

1. Explain what aerial nitrogen deposition is, what causes it, and (broadly) what  
regions of the world are currently most affected by this.  

- Reactive nitrogen in gaseous form  (nitrous oxides; NOx) can enter  terrestrial and aquatic systems  through wet or dry deposition
	- t**the input of reactive nitrogen from the atmosphere to the biosphere both as gases, dry deposition and in precipitation as wet deposition**.
- low in Canada
- Estimated Total Reactive  Nitrogen Deposition from  the Atmosphere 
- Accounts for **12%** of the  reactive nitrogen entering  ecosystems, although it is  higher in some regions (e.g.,  33% in the United States


# Part B: Effects of Nutrient Pollution on Biodiversity  
1. Explain what eutrophication is, and identify this as the major effect of nutrient  
pollution on marine and freshwater ecosystems.  
- can be coastal, or out into the ocean (e.g. migrating dead zone in tropcial North Atlantic, off coast of Africa)

1. Identify that adding reactive N and P to terrestrial systems increases net primary  
productivity, but tends to decrease plant and mycorrhizal fungus species richness.  
Explain the mechanism by which this occurs for plants, with reference to the leaf  
economic spectrum (i.e., plant adaptation to low vs. high nitrogen availability).  
Identify that higher nitrogen content in foliage tends to increase herbivory, and  
speed up plant decomposition.  

- **major mechanism: In ecosystems where N limits primary  
production, added N leads to one or a few N-  
responsive plant species becoming dominant**

- Net primary production and biomass are  increased by N addition, but overall species richness is often decreased


- one experience (4 replicates) : shows trend in increased  biomass but decreased species richness with increased nitrogen

![[Pasted image 20250305122845.png]]
(from 85 studies, 115 experiments - different plants species, length, etc.)

Other mechanisms where N affects biodiversity:
Positive feedback loops:
- Tissue produced by N-fertilized plants often decomposes and releases nutrients more rapidly than that of conspecific unfertilised plants  
- Where N deposition causes species replacement, the N-favoured spp  usually cycle more N through litter, and produce more readily  decomposable litter than do the spp they replace  drive positive  feedback towards increased availability of N


Why some species drop off: because of  central leaf economic spectrum traits:
(*how much plants invest in their leaves and their rate of growth - slow plants adapted to not use as much nitrogen whereas the fast-growing plants do, and out-compete the slow growing ones and the slow-growing ones dissappear if you add nitrogen*)

#### Effects on non-plant biodiversity - cascades up and down food web
- N additions (through fertilizers or aerial  deposition) can affect consumers,  decomposers, and symbionts as well as plants  
- Increases in N favor growth and survival of  many consumers  
- Can affect populations of predators and  parasites as well

##### Effects on mycorrhizal fungi
  
- N addition/deposition can reduce plant  dependence on / benefit to N-obtaining microbes, such as mycorrhizal fungi  
- Strong evidence for a decline in many spp of ectomycorrhizal fungi in the areas of Europe  most affected by N deposition

![[Pasted image 20250305124216.png]]
##### Phosphorus
- Effects of P pollution less well-studied than effects of N pollution  
- Found that, independent of level of N, plant species richness declined as soil P increased
- does not disappear quickly, not as quickly as N; Pervasive once it is there

Threshold where species loss stops (grassland study):
![[Pasted image 20250305123457.png | 500]]


### Thresholds

- **Nitrogen:** 500-1000 mg N /m2/yr has been  used as a threshold value for  sensitive ecosystems, though  effects may occur over the  longer term at lower levels (Erisman  et al. 2003)  
- **Phosphorus:** 104-130 mg P/kg soil established  for European grasslands (Ceulemans et  
al. 2014)

![[Pasted image 20250305124441.png]]


1. Identify that protected areas in much of the world currently receive aerial  
reactive N deposition at levels above the threshold known to cause ecological  
change.  
- Red PAs >1000 mg N /m2/yr , deposition increasing  
- Orange PAs >1000 mg N /m2/yr , deposition decreasing  
- Green PAs >500 mg N /m2/yr and increasing

1. Identify that human addition of reactive nitrogen to the environment can have  
both warming and cooling effects on the global climate system, via complex  
pathways.  

first, why do we use it: huge benefits to food production using N & P
- costs to terrestrial & aquatic biodiversity
- **both** warming and cooling effects on climate
- can affect greenhous gas pathways with volatile gases:
	-  can volatilize to NOx gases
	- can react to form ozone
	- can react with methane
	- can alter cycling of methane in wetlands





Part C: Prevention of Nutrient Pollution  


1. Identify strategies to prevent nutrient leaching and volatilization from  
agricultural areas.

1. Prevent Agricultural Nutrient Leaching
- Use urea or ammonium forms of N when possible  
	- Nitrate form (NO3-) is highly mobile and volatile)  
- Use fertiliser in an intelligent manner  
	- Correct rate 
	- Correct timing (part of growth cycle when it’s needed)  
	- Proper irrigation management  
	- Fertilizer planning for realistic yield goals (don’t apply amount for maximum yield under optimal conditions  f conditions are not optimal)  
	- Use available decision support tools

1. Wetlands as a Buffer
- Some artificially constructed wetlands have been  developed specifically to  treat N-rich sewage  effluents  

- Some wetlands have been  found to reduce  concentration of nitrate by  more than 80%  

- BUT wetlands can become hotspots of contamination  wastes can build up to concentrations high enough  to have detrimental effects on wetland function  
- 
- Threshold between where loadings are tolerated and  where they will do damage to wetlands is not easily  determined
