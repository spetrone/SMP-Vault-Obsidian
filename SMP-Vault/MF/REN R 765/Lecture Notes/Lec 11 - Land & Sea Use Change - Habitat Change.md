MEA: Habitat Change
IPSE: Land & Sea Use Change


objective: remember some mechanisms and relate them to how biodiversity is being lost

1) Name the 5 main direct drivers of biodiversity loss identified by the Millennium  
Ecosystem Assessment & IPBES report: 
- habitat change (also called land/sea use  
change), 
- overexploitation (also called direct exploitation) 
- invasive species,  
- climate change,
- pollution.  

1) Define habitat as:
- the biotic and abiotic requirements that a species has to be able  to survive and reproduce.-
- Identify that ‘habitat’ is technically species-specific, but  that “habitat change” or “habitat loss” often refers to loss of natural  vegetation/soil/natural area that provides habitat for *many species.*  



1) List and explain the mechanisms by which habitat loss causes biodiversity loss.  
Current trends and patterns of loss:  

Identify/list the following trends:  
A. 1/3 of the terrestrial land surface is used for cropping or animal husbandry;  
only 25% of terrestrial surface is minimally impacted  

B. Globally, agriculture is the biggest cause of terrestrial habitat loss  

C. Tropical forest is still being lost, with those in SE Asia having the greatest  
rate of loss  

D. Temperate forest loss was high in 1800s & 1900s; temperate forest cover is  
now increasing, though simplification is ongoing via management for wood &  
fibre production  

E. All highly productive areas (and 2/3 of total area) of the ocean are  
moderately to very highly impacted by human activity; only 3% minimally  
impacted  

F. Inland waters, including wetlands, show among the highest rates of decline




Additional notes:
**forest lost :** massive amounts > 50% is lost in tropics
3 major tropical regions are disappearing most rapidly
global forest area is now ~68% or pre-industrial level
	- did not know until satellites
more than 33% of mangroves lost - mostly in SE asia

Grassland and desert loss
	- generally less than forests -but heavily lost in North America and in grasslands in africa becoming desserts

most hit (forests):
- mediterranean forests
- Temperate forest-steppe and woodland  
- Temperate broadleaf forests  
- Tropical coniferous forests

Pattern of where:
- low-income countries
	- used to be from small-scale farmers and rural residents
- now, especially in tropics, land use change is substantially driven by  globalization promoting  intensive agriculture and  other industrial activities
- Large-scale agriculture (crops, livestock, tree  plantations) by corporations and wealthy  landowners is increasingly emerging as biggest  direct cause of tropical deforestation  E.g., Palm oil production in SE Asia
