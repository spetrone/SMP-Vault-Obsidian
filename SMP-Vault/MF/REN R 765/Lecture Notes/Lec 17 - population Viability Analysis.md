1. *Define and explain PVA, MVP, quasi-extinction, the Allee Effect, inbreeding  depression, and effective population size (Ne).*  

**Population Viability Analysis :**   the process of evaluating data and models to determine the likelihood at some chosen  probability that a population will persist for  some arbitrarily chosen time into the future

	- population size and persistence 
	- • “A cornerstone defining the field of  conservation biology”  (when endangered species conservation is the aim)

**Related to PVA  **: Minimum Viable Population (MVP)** - is a  threshold number of individuals that will  ensure, with some level of probability, that a  population willpersist in a viable state for a  given interval of time  
• Establishing an MVP is sometimes the end  goal of PVA


- *generally we are using extinction term to mean extirpation because it is not usually the last population of a species*

**Quasi-extinction:** the population size > 0 where  biological (or political) influences in extinction  risk become important (management threshold)  
- Populations may be in trouble long before they  go extinct & thus we may want to define some  quasi-extinction value (threshold size) rather than  it being zero (extinction)  
- This would allow a management and, possibly, a political response







2. *Describe the classes of PVAs, possible components of PVAs, possible uses of PVAs,  and limitations of PVAs.*  

a. count-based
b. demogrpahic-based
c. habitat-based

Components of PVAs
a. species traits
	- life history
	- habitats
b. environment
	- temporal variations
	- catastophes
c. demography
	- growth
	- size (N)
	- distribution


*Species traits, environment & demography interact with each  other. Traits of some species make them much more sensitive to environmental variations.*

##### Possible uses of PVA:
1. Assessment of extinction risk  
		a) Assessing risk of single population  
		b) Comparing relative risks of 2 or more populations  
		c) Analyzing and synthesizing monitoring data  
2. Guiding management  
		a) Identifying key life stages or demographic processes  
		b) Determining required size for a reserve  
		c) Determining number of individuals to release to increase successful reintroductions  
		d) Setting harvest limits  
		e) Deciding on the number of populations needed for  regional persistence


limitations
- best current data to project into future; conditions may change; projections only uncertain


3. *Given a description of a species’ biology, suggest PVA model components (process  model, deterministic and stochastic components) that would be needed to create a  realistic PVA for this species.*  

examples: “What population size is needed to be 95% certain that the  
population will persist for 100 years?”  

Implies some threshold for the # of individuals that will  assure (at some acceptable level of risk) that a population  will persist for a given interval of time

What number of bears is  viable?  
• How big of an area  (protected) is needed? (not calculated from MVP but linked with needed area per population)

- look at surviving and extinct populations for the size and average time to extinction for populations failing to survive

- How do you determine a MVP?  
	- Evaluate how chance (stochastic) events affect pops.:  
	- Simulate population growth in the presence of  
	- stochasticity (4 main sources [coming up])
	
Populations <50 bears occupying 2,500-km2 to  7,400-km2 (based on territory size) have <95%  chance of surviving 100 yrs. Minimum area needed  estimated to be 1,000-km2 to 13,500-km2


- more example in slides

4. *Name and explain the 4 sources of uncertainty in modeling future population  growth that PVAs often try to incorporate.*  

5. *Identify that as populations become smaller, stochastic processes become an increasing threat to the population’s survival. Explain how and why the following  processes threaten small populations, and identify the population size at which each  process becomes relevant: environmental stochasticity, loss of genetic  variability, inbreeding depression, demographic stochasticity, and Allee  effects. Explain the 50/500 rule and critique its utility.*




# state of the art model
Hierarchical multi-population viability analysis
- doesn't have long time series, instead uses few data from many locations; because we don't have much high quality data from long duration time series data
- process model (like above)
- sample model (occurrence probability)
- observational model (detection probability)


# Summary
- Population viability analysis uses data and models to predict the likelihood at some chosen probability that a  population will persist for a given amount of time  
- Minimum viable population analysis is related, and  seeks to determine the threshold number of  individuals necessary to maintain a viable population  for a given period of time at a chosen probability level  

- These analysis can be count based, demographic  based, or habitat based, and incorporate species traits,  demography, and environmental stochasticity.  

- PVA and MVP analyses can be used to assess extinction  risk and guide population management.
