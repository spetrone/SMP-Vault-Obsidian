1) List the 3 objectives for biodiversity research that contribute to informing us on  how to manage natural diversity.

1. determine what the natural state is
2. determine how the natural state is being perturbed
	1. habitat change
	2. climate change
	3. overexploitation
	4. invasive species
	5. pollution
3. Develop and implement measures to mitigate the disturbances, and, if necessary, restore the system


Scientific Study
- observe patterns/phenomena
- test what mechanisms cause observed patterns - seek to understand process

how does predictor variable affect response variable?
**question:**
E.g., How does pollution affect freshwater invertebrate diversity?

**hypothesis (include mechanism)**
E.g. Pollution reduces freshwater invertebrate diversity by producing conditions in which fewer species can survive

e.g. how does anthropogenic change driver affect : abundance, species richness, species diversity, species composition, etc. of urban winter birds?

4) List the typical variables measured in organismal biodiversity studies  
(abundance, species richness, species diversity, and species composition).

3) Explain what observational studies are and why they are usually required to  conduct biodiversity research. Identify the difference between an observational study and an experiment.  
**Observational studies**: required for whole system studies and looking at whole system responses; 
•An observational study chooses sites/times to take measurements of the response variable that span a wide range of values of the predictor variable

•Uses **replication** and **randomization** to try to ensure that variables that are not of interest are not correlated with the values of the predictor variable, so that if we find an apparent effect of the predictor variable on the response variable, we can be confident that it is really an effect of the predictor variable, not an effect of some variable that is correlated with the predictor variable



5) Recognize the difference between precise and vague wording in scientific  questions, hypotheses, and predictions, and explain the value of using precise  language.  

question:
 scientific question must clearly state the predictor and response variables being tested
 
hypothesis
- most not be ambiguous --> e.g. effect of outflow
	- provide descriptors where you can - e.g. direction of an effect
- descriptors must make sense for mechanisms or properties
	- e.g. "an increase in species composition" does not apply to this, it is bivariate and you cannot use a univariate descriptor on it

predictions:
- help to clarify  whether you've designed study to test what you want to test

Form of scientific questions:
1. determine what the natural state is
`e.g.  How does [natural change driver] affect [higher taxon] abundance, species richness, species diversity, and species composition?

2. determine how the natural state is being perturbed
` How does [global change driver] affect [higher taxon] abundance, species richness, species diversity, and species composition?`


Experiemntal studies:
- controls and manipulated variables - and then measure the effect
- not effective in ecology and biodiversity studies - does not translate out of lab
- observational studies don't have a control group --> instead REPLICATION AND RANDOMIZATION

7) Differentiate between and define the following terms: scientific hypothesis,  
scientific prediction, and statistical hypothesis. Explain why scientific  
hypotheses are important to the scientific process.  

### Hypothesis
- the careful thinking!
- functions:
	- a thinking process for you - to think of all possible correlative variables; can support this mental math with references from literature - can find links. 
	- a communication tool
- hypothesis formally connect your planned research with existing background literature
	- if it does not draw tightly on existing knowledge is likely to:
		- rediscover known information
		- make wrong conlcusions
		
**hypothesis:** what is the underlying process we are testing
`Predictor variable affects response variable by mechanism

`E.g. Pollution reduces freshwater invertebrate diversity by producing conditions in which fewer species can survive

**prediction:** expectation to find - bring hypothesis down to the specifics of the study
- more effective the more specific you are
- can get from literature
- give range if possible
`If mechanism occurs, I will find [predicted value of response variable] for [given values of predictor variable] 

`E.g. I will find decreasing freshwater invertebrate diversity as pollution increases

##### Scientific vs Statistical Hypothesis

**Scientific Hypothesis**: proposed cause and effect mechanism
` predictor variable affects response variable because (mechanism proposed)`

**Statistical Hypothesis**: statement about a relationship between variables in a dataset
	Null hypothesis (H0): relationship between predictor and response variable is not observed
	 Alternate hypothesis (HA): relationship between predictor and response variable is observed
	 *no cause and effect - depends on both statistics AND study design*

6) Explain the function of statistical analysis in the scientific process and why statistical analysis is almost always used in biodiversity research.  

**Descriptive statistics** – to describe data
- measures of central tendency - mean, average

**Inferential statistics** – To test whether patterns that we see in data occur due to variables of interest (predictor variables) or random chance (other unmeasured causal variables)


- why used in biodiversity?
	- so much variation - some is interesting some is not
		- interesting variation - variation in response variable due to predictor variables
		- statistical null hypothesis testing helps us to determine how repeatable any observed effects of our predictor variable(s) on our response variable should be
		- parse out signal of noise of variation from other variables

8) Define the terms P-value and “statistically significant”  

**P-value** = probability of finding an effect of the predictor variable on the response variable as large as you did, if there really is no effect

**Statistically significant** = unlikely to have occurred by chance; a p-value lower than a set threshold (traditionally 0.05)

10) Explain how to determine effect size from a comparison of means or a simple  linear regression, and be able to compare these for different graphs. Explain the  difference between effect size and statistical significance.

***Effect Size ->***  How big of an effect was there of the predictor variable on the response variable?


12. **Comparison of means (T-test, ANOVA)**
- ***difference*** between means for t-test and ANOVA
- The bigger the difference in means between levels of the predictor variable, the bigger the effect size
	- 2 x length of error bar between means - then P-value should be less than 0.05
- p-value repeatability - if we repeated the experiment 100 times, 95 times out of 100, we would find this difference in means (this effect size)

14. **Linear Regression**
- **slope*** - the magnitude of slope is the effect size
- must calculate error (R^2) - low R^2 is less association between predictor and response variable - i.e. low confidence
- for two plots with the same scatter - the more slope, the more significance
- for two plates with the same slope, the less scatter, the more significance
- because of the combination of two effects on significance - cannot interpret well visually


Statistical Analysis/Significance --> What is the probability of an association this strong between the predictor variable and response variable having been observed by chance if there is actually no relationship?

- Report P-value (repeatability)

- For regression also report R^2 -> tells you the % of the total variation in the response variable that is explained by the predictor variable
- The smaller the overlap in error bars, the higher the significance (or repeatability) of this effect

![[Pasted image 20250117121731.png]]


- should always report both effect size and statistical significance

16) Define what is meant by an interaction between 2 predictor variables. Identify  that a study must have a factorial design to be able to detect interactions. (Define  what “factorial design” means.)

- **interactive effects** occur when two or more variables combine to affect a response variable in a different way together than each would alone



![[Pasted image 20250117122505.png]]

- Ecological systems are complex, and interactive effects of different variables (change drivers) on biodiversity are the rule rather than the exception
- Interactive effects are different than additive effects.)

##### Factorial design
***don't usually have a control in real biodiversity studies***
- test all possible combinations of variable levels or values = factorial of the variables
- a factorial design (= all combinations of all levels of all predictor variables are tested)
	- must have replicates of each combination
- Interactions between variables that affect biodiversity are common, and factorial designs, where each “cell” has good replication are necessary to be able to detect interactions.
Visualize interactions:
- look for a variation of effects with different predictor variables:
- e.g.  
![[Pasted image 20250117123152.png]]
Interactive: High - difference for grazing is lower than no grazing vs Medium, gazing is higher than no grazing, and same for low 
Not Interactive: no variation with different combinations of predictor variables
# Additional Notes:
### Replication and Randomization:

**Replication** = repeating your test to see if your results are repeatable. Each replicate is independent evidence as to whether any effect of your predictor variable on your response variable is real
- sometimes replication not sufficient - when not enough replications
- insufficient randomization: can also have issues with gradient - cannot separate clustered replicates from gradient which adds an other relationship
- also want to avoid possible gradients where replication would not actually be replicating many of the variables - adds confounding variables

**Randomization** – function is to reduce potential sources of bias or correlation between your predictor variable and extraneous, unmeasured variables that may affect your response variable, so that you can clearly detect any effects of your predictor variable 



should you have more sampling in a larger area when comparing to a smaller area?
- but create an unbalanced statistical design
- statistical power is better with a balanced design
- want to have a high enough signal to noise ratio - higher than variability between sites

- abundance not effected by sampling area
	- only affects species richness
	- sampling area has relationship with area --> however, could use means to compare still though
- placement of sites is important to:
	- control for potentially correlated variables
	- minimize spatial biases on response variables (but mean species richness is a solution)

**Causal Effect**:
causal effect of one variable on the other if the study that collected the data was designed in such a way that we can be confident that no other uncontrolled variables were actually affecting the response variable (or both variables) without our realizing it


**Hypothesis with an interaction:**
- An interaction means that the effect of one predictor variable on a response variable depends on the value of the second predictor variable

- You may hypothesize that there is or isn’t an interaction à think about your predictor variables and findings from the background literature to decide!

- Example of a hypothesis saying that there IS an interaction: *“We hypothesize that the effect of precipitation on bird recruitment will depend on the level of berry abundance, such that we will see a larger negative effect of precipitation when berry abundance is low than when berry abundance is high, because when berry abundance is low, birds will not easily be able to compensate for the added thermal stress from high precipitation by eating more berries.”*

Writing the hypothesis:

1) State whether you think there will or will not be an interaction

2) State the nature of the interaction (similar to direction of effect)

3) State the mechanism
