### **Part A: Patterns of Human-Caused Extinction**  

1) Recall that there have been at least **680** human-caused extinctions since 1500.  
- different numbers arise from how species are grouped / if you include sub-species
- based on background rate 0.1 - 2 extinctions per million species per year

1) Identify that more island species have gone extinct than mainland species and  explain why, and identify that predation has caused many more of the known extinctions than competition.  
- for both terrestrial vertebrates and plants
- exotic-facilitated as well on islands
- predation includes human predation, pathogens, and more
- predation alone 33% of these extinction
- predation + other (e.g. habitat loss)- over 40%
- below 10% composition
- exotic species - 30-34% of extinctions caused by exotic species

1) Identify that human-caused species invasions have facilitated at least 30% of all  known extinctions.  
- **Human-caused species invasions have facilitated 30-34%**
e.g. New Zealand - 51% of birds lost to extinction
- from introduced species - predators, like rats, cats, etc.
- disharmonic flora and fauna - followed different evolutionary trajectory than those on a mainland
	- this makes them at risk of extinction with introduced species
	- however - island and montane islands in the sky - tend to be more locally abundant with comparably-sized mainland ranges

Part B: IUCN Red List & COSEWIC  
1) Identify the IUCN Red List as a tool for assessing extinction risk in a standardized  manner. (Write what IUCN stands for.) Identify that the IUCN system has 5  quantitative criteria, and a species is designated to a threat category if it meets at  least one of them.  
- IUCN : International Union for Conservation of Nature 
- systems by which we assess extinction risk
- democratic union bringing together experts - 17,000 experts; >1400 member organizations
- Creates the **red list** - what is the status of each species
- 5 quantitative criteria - species but into threat category if it meets at least one of the
	- vulnerable, endangered, critically endangered


1) Identify IUCN’s 5 criteria for designating extinction risk status as: 
a) population  reduction;
b) geographic range in the form of either extent of occupancy or area of  occupancy; 
c) small population size and decline;
d) very small or restricted  population
 e) quantitative analysis indicating probability of extinction in the wild.

   ![[Pasted image 20250210122320.png]]

quantitative analysis:
- not all information available
- • Extent of occurrence (EOO) = area contained within  
shortest continuous imaginary boundary that can be  
drawn to encompass all known, inferred or projected  
sites of present occurrence of a taxon, excluding cases  
of vagrancy  
• Area of occupancy (AOO) = area within its extent of  
occurrence which is occupied by a taxon, excluding  
cases of vagrancy  
– Reflects fact that a taxon will usually not occur throughout  
the area of its extent of occurrence  
– Should be calculated using standard grid cell size of 2 km  
for comparability between taxa
- use EOO
- 


1) Name the independent advisory panel that determines the risk status of species  in Canada. (Acronym and long form.)  Part C: Estimating Extinction Rates  
- Committee On the Status of  Endangered Wildlife in Canada - COSEWIC
- Members are wildlife biology experts from academia, government, NGOs, and the private  sector
- Responsible for designating wildlife species in  danger of disappearing from Canada
- Meets twice a year to assess status of wildlife species at risk of extinction

We assess current extinction risk for a given species  
with systems for categorization of threat




1) Explain why extinctions and extinction rates are difficult to measure, and why  estimates of extinction rates are uncertain.  
- hard to measure accurately, even in the present
- every method of estimation has known problems
- be skeptical when you hear extinction rates
- Best consensus - MEA
-   Many scientists present different estimates  
- ALL of these involve major assumptions  
- We have no idea of the accuracy of these  estimations; some worse than others.
	- most certainty : what has happened in the recent past - last 500 years because they have been documented
![[Pasted image 20250210123057.png]]
- bottom of green bar is most certain value
	- reason they are wide is that we haven't searched exhaustively to see if they are extinct
- bottom of red bar is low certainty and top is speculative
- compared to fossil record - we think it is higher than the "average" extinction rate



1) Explain the concept of extinction debt.  

- Extinction debt = a time-lag before  
populations reduced in numbers by habitat  
loss actually go extinct

- explains: Discrepancy in SAR-based extinction  
predictions and lack of observed extinctions  
(at those levels)

2) Using SAR to predict extinctions  
• Discrepancy in SAR-based extinction  
predictions and lack of observed extinctions  
(at those levels) has been explained by  
‘Extinction debt’  
- species are clustered spatially, need aggregated spatial patterns - extinction occurs much more gradually than predicted by SAR
• instead use endemics-area-relationship:* 
	- go forward along EAR rather than backwards along SAR
		- we don't really have endemic area curves - hard to actually measure - we do not have the data
	- SAR backward method overestimates  extinction rates by 83-85%
	- doesn’t mean that extinction debt doesn’t  occur (it just can’t be predicted based on SAR)
	- doesn’t mean that habitat loss is not a  HUGE threat to extant species

Part D: Mass Extinction vs. Background Extinction  

***Are we already in the 6th mass extinction (caused by us)?***

1) Define background extinction and mass extinction. List the 3 criteria for an  extinction to be considered a mass extinction, and identify that there have been 5  mass extinctions in Earth’s history.

**Background extinction** = the rate at which  
species have gone extinct through time (as  
assessed through the fossil record)

**Mass extinction** = relatively sudden, global  
decrease in diversity of life forms  
– Has occurred periodically throughout the  
existence of life on Earth

**3 Criteria for a mass extinction:**
  
- Extinctions occur all over the world  
- A large number and many types of species go extinct  
(75%)  
-  Extinctions are clustered in a short amount of  geological time (2 million years or shorter)  


1) Identify that the vast majority of extinctions have been background extinctions.  Explain what can cause background extinction, in the absence of anthropogenic  factors.  
- Rate estimated to be 1-10 species/year  
- Most extinctions occur as background extinctions  
- Up to 95% of all extinctions that have ever  
happened to date have been background  
extinctions  

- Not caused by major catastrophes or climatic  
changes  

-  **Caused by:**
	- small changes in climate or habitat,  
	- depleted resources
	- , competition other changes  that require adaptation and flexibility
	
	- Competition  - 
	- Bad genes or bad luck?  
	- Demographic stochasticity  
	- Environmental stochasticity  
	- Small population size contributes to susceptibility to all of the above  
	What causes background extinction?

1) Describe the Red Queen Hypothesis of Coevolution. 

Red Queen Hypothesis = natural selection  
continuously operates on each species to keep  
up with improvements made by competing  
species/predators/parasites

*lineage age does not make a species more likely to avoid extinction - must continuously evlve to adapt to abiotic and biotic environmental changes*

1) Identify that human changes to ecosystems have increased the extinction rate  above the average extinction rate from the fossil record, but that whether we have  increased the extinction rate out of the normal range of variability is uncertain.  
- Identify that currently **nowhere near 75% of known species have gone extinct**. List  and discuss uncertainties inherent in assessment of how current anthropogenic  extinction rates compare to historical background extinction rates.  

- difficult to compare extinction rates when the bins for time periods vary significantly 
	- used 4600 taxon duration records
	- with 500 year interval - no upper limit on upper end of confidence interval - cannot tell if it is more than historical because it is such a short period.
	
	- we are above the average when we account for all threatened and endangered species; better for comparison when we use the averages.
	
	- also species:genus ratios are all estimates, including in the fossil record

- background rate: estimated at 1-10 species/yr

Part E: Patterns of Species Rarity  

- Shifting baseline --> most species are getting rarer - has fallen by 20%
- global biomass of wild mammals has fallen by 82 per cent

important for species conservation:
	- which species are at greatest risk of extinction
	- causes of extinction
	- extinction rates (historical and ccurent)

1) Identify that the species most at risk of extinction are rare species, and list and  explain 3 ways in which species can be rare 
- low population density
	- Large animals are more at risk
	- need more space == lower population density
- rare habitat
- small geographic range  


1) Identify that species have the highest density near the center of their ranges,  and density declines toward the boundaries.  

niche-centroid hypothesis




1) Identify that there is a pattern of ranges of small-ranged species concentrating  into certain regions (often mountains, islands), which are often not where the  greatest numbers of species are found, and that this pattern occurs across taxa.  Identify that this leads to geographic concentrations of rare species, or the species at  greatest risk of extinction. Discuss the relevance of this for designating global  conservation priority areas.  

- Species with small ranges are often  
geographically concentrated  == "small range species"
• Those concentrations are generally not where  
the greatest numbers of species are found  
• However, those concentrations tend to be in  
the same places for taxa of different origins
--> why? e.g. islands, montane islands, glaciation history

- many of these have lost substantial amounts of native vegetation (we have good data on it so that is why we know)
- these should be prioritized for conservation if species conservation is a focus
	- where are the rarest species
	- where are the hotspots?
	- where has been the most habitat loss --> 

1) Identify that, relative to other parts of the world, Europe and North America  have few species, few species with small ranges, and the small-ranged species that  do exist in these places are not geographically concentrated.
- makes conservation prioritization very different from the rest of the world
- not a lot of extinction across these continents as a result of habitat loss - when linking effect of habitat loss with extinction


3) Identify that the vast majority of extinctions have been background extinctions.  Explain what can cause background extinction, in the absence of anthropogenic  factors.  

4) Describe the Red Queen Hypothesis of Coevolution.  

5) Identify that human changes to ecosystems have increased the extinction rate  above the average extinction rate from the fossil record, but that whether we have  increased the extinction rate out of the normal range of variability is uncertain.  Identify that currently nowhere near 75% of known species have gone extinct. List  and discuss uncertainties inherent in assessment of how current anthropogenic  extinction rates compare to historical background extinction rates.  

Part E: Patterns of Species Rarity  

6) Identify that the species most at risk of extinction are rare species, and list and  explain 3 ways in which species can be rare (low population density, rare habitat,  small geographic range).  

7) Identify that species have the highest density near the center of their ranges,  and density declines toward the boundaries.  

8) Identify that there is a pattern of ranges of small-ranged species concentrating  into certain regions (often mountains, islands), which are often not where the  greatest numbers of species are found, and that this pattern occurs across taxa.  Identify that this leads to geographic concentrations of rare species, or the species at  greatest risk of extinction. Discuss the relevance of this for designating global  conservation priority areas.  

9) Identify that, relative to other parts of the world, Europe and North America  have few species, few species with small ranges, and the small-ranged species that



Notes:

**WHY uncertain:**
10. No proven direct methods for estimation of  extinction rates, except for the case of known  extinctions in places that Europeans have colonized  
11. Lack of reliable data for verifying extinctions

Methods:
12. Count known extinctions since we started  documenting species diversity and divide  these by the amount of time in which they  occurred
	- most likely to notice large-bodied organisms, slow-reproducing
	- more likely to overestimate other types of species
13. Use the species area relationship to try to  predict extinctions based on area lost
	- this has been shown to be wrong (shown by prof )
	- thought we could work backwards along curve
		- e.g. if we reduce habitat area by 90% - about half species will be lost: s led to predictions that  50% of all species would be lost by the year 2000
