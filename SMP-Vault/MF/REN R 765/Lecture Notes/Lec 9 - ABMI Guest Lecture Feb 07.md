Specific Learning Objectives for Lecture 9  
(Exam questions will test only these learning objectives from this lecture)  
By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:  
1) Describe Alberta’s biodiversity monitoring program, listing higher taxa  monitored, methods (high level), spatial extent, spatial and temporal grain of  monitoring.  
purpose: track changes in wildlife and their habitats - to provide information to improve land management
- advances and delivers biodiversity monitories for resource management and land stewardship

key 
- geographic scope
- taxonomic breath - 3400 species

- linking habitat changes directly to species outcomes
- predicted changes in relative abundance

- higher taxa monitored
	- indicators for broadest range of biodiversity
	- e.g. birds and mammals and bats and amphibians
		- autonomous recording units
- boots-on-the-ground:
	- soil mites, vascular plants, lichens, aquatic invertebrates, bryophytes
	- ~100,000 speciments/year

- high-level methods
- spatial extent
- spatial and temporal grain:
	- every 20km
	- 1656 terrestrial
	- 1656 wetland
	- repeat sampling through time

- many new species to science
	- e.g. recent 1400 page manuscript

monitoring programs:

1. Coarse filter approach - provincial scale - landscape level
	1. human footprint inventory
	2. earth observation insights
		- variety of remote-sensing datasets
		- e.g. hydro-temporal variability (in surface water), algal bloom monitoring
	3. geospatial foundations (imaging center)
		1. data acquisition and processing
		2. acquire and process ~50,000 km2 of new liDAR and aerial imagery data each year
		3. create training and validation datasets from photointerpretation, oblique imagery and ground-truthing data
		4. machine-learning based classifications to report on vegetation cover, heigh, class, recover, etc.
		5. Soil health
	
2. Fine Filter

3) Explain how ABMI defines and measures human footprint.  

human footprint: management changes to human footprint across alberta
definition: visible alteration/conversion of natural ecosystems to support human land-use (temporary or permanent)

- produce AB-side human footprint inventory by mapping:
	- 21 layers of HF types
		- more than 115 feature types
		- more than 5 million features in the dataset

4) Access data on individual species’ abundances and distributions via the ABMI  website. (This objective is not for exams, but could have applications to your lab  group project investigating factors affecting urban winter bird habitat use.)  

5) Explain the difference between DNA barcoding, metabarcoding, and eDNA.  Consider the process (what goes in, what kind of reference library do you need to  interpret the results?) Discuss advantages and disadvantages of each method, relative to each other and relative to morphological identification.

DNA Barcoding
- like UPC codes
- selecting highly identifying genes (high variation across species or specific to species) for sequencing 
	- more different between species than within species
- steps:
	- morphologically identify species
	- build a reference library
- uses:
	- for small, cryptic and immature species
 
Metabarcoding
- instead of looking at one organism, simultaneously look at multiple organisms at once --> i.e. multiplexed DNA barcoding

eDNA
- whole environmental sample
- pull out metabarcoding from sample and list of species

Advantages:
- reduced impact on target species
- reduced dependence on taxonomic experts
- retroactive addition of indicator taxa
- simplification of field operations

Challenges:
- completeness of barcode library
- primer availability
- site-specific factors
- relative abundance
- signal persistence - length of time genetic signal persists in environment


Taxonomic impediment:
the need > taxonomic resources

look up biodiversity pathways

releasing liDAR data 
- some sensitivity
- to be publicly released - some years are available
	- e.g. Caribou habitat
	- Caribou habitat tracker
	- ABMI
