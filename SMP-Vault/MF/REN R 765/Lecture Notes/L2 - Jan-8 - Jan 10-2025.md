## Biodiversity 
today - this term in its broadest sense (next lecture - different technical meanings)

- see specific learning objectives for lecture 2 for what is important in this lecture (copy and pasted here):
- first discussion class -what should objectives be for managing diversity in case study area


### Specific Learning Objectives for Lecture 2:

1) *Explain how our understanding of biological diversity has changed over time, by listing relevant advances in biology and how they contributed.*
- Indigenous vs colonial views on biodiversity were different
	- Indigenous people had a very different picture (and much larger) of biodiversity - e.g. more things are considered living + living in harmony. What they could manage was done on what can be seen by the naked eye. 
	- now what we can see, measure, and manage has grown over time so that is larger. There were pivotal changes in our understanding of life on earth.
	- colonial views of biodiversity were in exploiting biodiversity.
	- Historically, we have managed individual species, so there is a lot of research and room for methods development.  Not much experience in managing biodiversity. We probably do not even know what managing biodiversity means.
- Advances:
	- Evolution (Darwin)
	- Genetics/inheritence (Mendel)
	- DNA (Wallace & Crick)
	- Genomics


Several ***axes*** of biodiversity (following millenium ecosystem assessment)
- based on hierarchy: nucleotides - genes- chromosomes - individuals - populations (genetic selection occurs here) -species

1) *Define ‘biodiversity’, including the various organizational levels at which biodiversity is important: within-species (genetic diversity), between-species (species diversity), and between species interactions, ecological processes, and environmental conditions (ecosystem diversity).*

- **broad definition:** a variety of life forms
	- shift aim of managing individual resource species to managing a "variety of species"

- within-species diversity (genetic diversity)
-  between-species diversity (species diversity)/taxonomic/organismal diversity - species and higher taxa
- environmental conditions (ecosystem diversity)
- between-species interactions
- ecological processes
- cultural diversity within species (new)
	- e.g. dialects in songbirds, orca communications, lions sleeping in trees, etc.


Genetic Diversity

3) *Identify that genetic diversity within a population increases with: population size, stability of population size, and proximity to the centre of a species’ geographic range.*

- across species: high variability in genome size, number of chromosomes, and number of genes
	- within-species - most important for managing as variation allows for adaptation
		- larger population - generally more variation
		- increases with stability of population size
			- at each period of contraction (bottleneck) a lot of genetic material is lost
		- proximity to the center of a species geographic range - ideal spot in geographic range

Taxonomic / ‘Organismal’ Diversity
- the usual axis for biodiversity 
- based on taxonomic definition of organisms
	
	
4) *Give the range in estimates for number of species of prokaryotes (and define what a prokaryote is).*

- prokaryotes - millions or hundreds of millions of species 
- no membrane-bound organelles, no nucleus, single-cell only

6) *Give our ‘working’ estimate of extant eukaryote species. (For this course, consider this number to be **8 million**, despite the inconsistency that the table on slide 17 counts only 7.79 million.) Define what a eukaryote is.*
 - eukaryotes - membrane bound organelles, including nucleus, unicellular or multicellular exist - roughly 8 million (estimate from millenium ecosystem assessment)
 - dominance of arthropods (4.5 - 6 million)
 - cordates (50,000 - mostly fish)

7) *Describe how we arrive at estimates of the number of species on Earth, and where the biggest uncertainties lie.*

Numbers of species estimated in a given area, for  different ecosystem types and these are extrapolated to the entire globe based on the % of globe covered by that ecosystem type
- species-area relationships extrapolated by ecosystem type to the whole world == number of NEW species per area
- counting species
- asking taxonomic experts
- temporal patterns of species description
- proportions of undescribed species in samples, well-studied areas and new study areas

Extra uncertainty:
Certain habitats are difficult:
	-deep sea (access), soils(small, high diversity, tropical forest canopies (hard to access)
in higher taxa, which are very species rich, or which are hard to distinguish:
	- nematodes
	- arthropods
functional groups which are hard to study:
	parasites
	parasitoids (internal parasites)

It is highly biased: e.g. birds, lilies overstudied, arachnids, gastropods understudied
	- often by society preference rather than on scientific research

Rate of species description: 13,000 per year (36/day)
	at this rate need 462 years

8) *Give our ‘working’ estimate of the number of **described** species on Earth (**2 million**), and the source of this estimate (**Millennium Ecosystem Assessment 2005**), and explain why we are uncertain of the number of already described species.*

- 2 million DESCRIBED species
- lack of a single, complete, well-maintained database of valid formal names
	- have GBIF Global Biodiversity information Facility is the biggest
- source of error: synonymy and homonymy 
	- synonymy: one species under different names
	- homonymy: one name to group of cryptic species (common with arthropods, and parasitic wasp) - needs DNA barcoding for many species often no morphological differences
- likely more parasitoid wasps (Hymenoptera) than beetles or  2 for every 5 hosts calculation

Ecosystem (Ecological) Diversity
populations - habitats - ecosystems - ecoregions - provinces - biomes - biogeographic realms


8) Explain how we classify ecosystem diversity. Give advantages and disadvantages of classifying biodiversity at the level of ecosystems.
- most apparent categorization to us
- least satisfactory categorization of biodiversity because:
	- categories are arbitrary
	- regions often merge along gradients (where does one end/start)
	- includes also abiotic components - adds complexity
	
- recent interest in delineating ecoregions and biomes for the purpose of conservation planning
- growing sense of standardization
- **Ecoregion:** a large unit of area containing geographically distinct species assemblages and environmental conditions
	- categorized in **biomes** 
		- then categorized in biogeographic realms
	- need to know the map and names of realms

Spatial Distribution of Global Biodiversity

9) Name (and be able to circle on a map) the 3 most biodiverse biogeographic realms, and rank them in number of species.

Biogeographic realms are based off *terrestrial* not marine - there are regions for marine

Terrestrial: Neotropics > Afrotropics > Indo-Malaya (though ranking depends on what level/group of taxonimic diversity is measured) - this is for species (not families), however more famils in Afrotropics vs Neotropics


Marine (bio-geographic region): Western Indo-Pacific and Central Indo-Pacific are a center for evolutionary radiation of many groups (e.g., global hotspot of marine species richness and endemism)

11) Describe how species richness varies with latitude (or the ‘latitudinal gradient in species diversity’).
- species richness increases towards lower (tropical) latitudes
	- true for  total, rare OR threatened species richness - the pattern holds
	- true also for soil diversity
	- peak is 20-30 degrees north of equator and the gradient is asymmetrical (tapers off faster going north and slower south)
		- this tapering of species richness is species-specific - e.g. much faster for butterflies vs birds
- biased based on where more research occurs


11) List 3 processes that generate higher species richness in some parts of the world. List constraints on speciation, extinction rates, and species range movements.
- greater levels of speciation
- lower levels of extinction
- greater net movements of geographic ranges
- productive energy (amount of available solar energy from photosynthesis for food webs)
- ambient energy - potential for mutations in DNA - i.e. danger of sun = more mutations
- topographic variation - e.g. mountain ranges, more population separation, gradients, and niches
- climatic variation - more likely for species to go extinct

Biodiversity Through Time

12) Give our best estimate of the range for a normal species lifespan through time (**1-10 million years**).
Estimate:  1-10 million years
- at any specific time, the extant species would have represented 0.2 -2 % of species that ever lived


Biodiversity through time
- *millions of years* between appearance of many groups that are now providing diversity 
- changes in variety of species
	- e.g. number of genera of marine invertebrates through time - it fluctuates over time
	- most species that have ever existed are extinct
- Several mass extinctions have occurred
	- had a hugely disruptive effect on the development of biodiersity
	- it has recovered each time and it takes a few million years to recover - with many very different species


#### Summary:
- only recently 1992 and onward (convention on biological diversity) are we trying to conserve biodiversity
	- definition in convention: includes genetic, organismal and ecosystem diversity for both marine and terrestrial freshwarer
- genetic and species diversity are the easiest to describe consistently
- not finished
- tropical regions are more diverse
