1. Explain why we might want to model population growth, and articulate the goals and limitations of modeling.  

 **species-level tactical modeling**: statistical models that summarize important patterns and relationships in data generated by individual observational studies
- can also be constructed by combing the findings from multiple studies into a single process-based model
- focus will be on ***population viability analysis***
	- based on basic model - simple population growth models
- other: ***habitat suitability***
- other: ***landscape analysis*** (incl. climate modeling)
	- coarser, higher level


Why:
- Predict future population size  
- Describe pop. **growth rate and size in terms of mechanisms** that could influence growth rate  
- Compare growth and **relevant mechanisms** to  those of other populations


**Modeling Population Growth**
Models  
	• Abstractions of reality  
	• Exclude more than they include  
	• Goal is to capture key features that are  
	particularly interesting and useful

3 dichotomies:
- discrete vs. continuous
- density-dependent v.s density-independent
- deterministic vs. stochastic

process model: process of reproduction

2. Explain what is meant by each of the following types of population growth model:  discrete, continuous, density-independent, density-dependent, deterministic,  stochastic.  

- logistic growth equation and theoretical constructs based on it are reified.
###### Discrete growth (geometric shape): 
- calculated over a specific time interval
- appropriate for populations that breed in discrete intervals or seasons
- e.g. sea turtles, periodic cicadas

###### Continuous Growth (smooth shape/curve/exponential):
- when reproduction occurs continuously, the population can begin to add to itself right away
- appropriate for populations that breed continuously, when individuals reproduce out of step with one another
- e.g. bacteria, humans

###### Density-Independent
- useful place to start because more complex models include this process
- often occurs until populations get close to carrying capacity
- **Density-independence** = lack of statistical relationship between the density of a population and its per capita growth rate


###### Density-Dependent Growth
- growth rate depends on population density
- more likely as population reaches carrying capacity
- also called "logistic growth"
- sigmoid curve
- rarely observed in real data from nature
	- can describe laboratory populations of some organisms well
	- competition is not biggest driver then; neither are resources - why not seen often
		- more stochasticity

###### Deterministic Growth Models
- process-based
	- reproduction process
	- in density-dependent growth models - density-dependence - growth slows as population increases
- start with a given population size, a given per capita rate of increase, and a given period of time -> project a final population size
- model will give you the same answer every time, unless you change the parameters


##### Stochastic Growth Models (Simulation Models)
- process-based, but also incorporate stochasticity
- can either:
	- use a process for generating stochasticity ( e.g. randomly draw values to add to r from a normal distribution with mean equal to r)
	- use observed stochasticity

3. Identify that the “process” incorporated into any basic population growth model is geometric (or exponential) population increase, and that from that starting point  we can add other features to the model, like a changing per capita growth rate as  carrying capacity is reached (for density-dependent growth models) or stochasticity  (for stochastic growth models).  

- change parameters to alter outcome
	- outcome always the same for the same parameters for stochastic models

4. Identify that logistic growth patterns aren’t actually observed very commonly in  
nature, but that this model can form the base of more useful models that have  
additional processes (mechanisms affecting population growth) added.  


5. Explain the difference between deterministic population modeling and stochastic  modeling (simulation) of population growth. Why might we want to do one or the other? Explain one method of simulating future population sizes.

- determine if it is continuous or discreate
- include process in deterministic
- include stochasticity in stochastic models
- determine if density will be included
e.g. 
## Average Discrete Growth Rates

- λ is the per capita rate of increase over a set period of time if the population is growing  geometrically  
	- if continuous, would be an "exponential" increase
	- since it is discrete, it is "per-capita" increase
- It is the ‘true’ average  
-  Any real population will have a fluctuating per capita increase from year to year (due to  environmental factors, etc.)  
- We may want to measure annual growth rate over several years and calculate the average, to estimate λ

- subtract growth values to calculate lambdas and plot them
- you want to get lambda from several years of data, plot, and take the predicted intercept - from mean
	- called R because it is an ESTIMATE; the true value is λ

e.g. Discrete, Deterministic,  
Density-Independent Model Example

# Estimates of lambda == R

- use a geometric mean rather than a geometric mean - used with data points related to each other by a multiplicative value rather than a summative value
	- needed for multiplicative relationships between numbers in the sequence - this is necessary for population growth
	- if using arithmetic mean it is much too high (arithmetic means always higher than geometric means)
- ![[Pasted image 20250319180632.png]]
![[Pasted image 20250319181036.png]]
- rd = per capita pirths = per-capita deaths

Can then use the estimate of lambda (from e.b. 50 years of data) to parameterize a population growth model:

e.g. starting from 43 sparrows, how many in 50 years?

## Other notes:

- in-situ - in natural habitat
- ex-situ
	- very difficult
	- need enough specifics of biology 
	- very species-specific

Summary of Discrete, Deterministic,  
Density-Independent Model Example
- Discrete population growth models assume that  
reproduction occurs in discrete bursts  
- Density-independent growth models, at their  most basic, assume a geometric increase in  population size over time  
 The discrete growth model equation is Nt = λt N0 , where λ is the finite rate of increase, or (1 + rd),  and rd is the discrete growth increment  
- This model was deterministic, because there is  only one possible outcome of the model once we   have set the parameters.


### Modeling with Data: Simulated Dynamics
- includes stochasticity
- simulation used to quantify uncertainty in models for future population growth
- will do example with simulating density independent growth


Here we will use Rt (estimates of λ) to simulate the dynamics of song sparrow counts 
We will:  
1. Look at and collect the data (annual R’s)  
2. Simulate one projection  
3. Scale up to multiple simulations (1000’s)  
4. Analyze the output

- randomly draw 50 Rs drawn with replacement
- multiple previous years population size to project population size into the future
- now repeat simulations with many (thousands of simulations)

Analyze the output:
- Extract the last year of simulations and  summarize it:  
- **Median** final pop. size is 49 individuals, though  some pops. went extinct, and one got to be a size  of 176,104 individuals
- create 95% confidence interval, and filter out edges
	- We can calculate quantiles as a form of  empirical confidence intervals  
	- These quantiles suggest that in 2053, we might observe sparrow counts anywhere from  0 to 6584

Method:
- One way is to use original data, and sample it  randomly to calculate model parameters  
	- Simulations are random, but based on our best available knowledge
- could also take mean, create a normal distribution, and sample ffrom the distribution instead of using observed stochasticity


Learning Objectives  
1. Purpose and goals of modeling population  growth  
2. Discrete vs. continuous growth models  
3. Density-independent vs. density-dependent  growth  
4. Deterministic population growth modeling  vs. stochastic population growth models  (simulation)


### Reification:
Reification consists of accepting a designation as if it has empirical meaning, when in fact, its existence has never been tested or it has been found empty



### Summary
- Deterministic population growth models treat future  population size as the outcome of mechanistic processes  that will happen the same way every time.  
- Stochastic population growth models (simulation models)  can also be process-based, but also incorporate  stochasticity, such that different model runs produce  different predicted final population sizes.  
- Stochastic models are a way to quantify uncertainty about  future population growth.  
- Simulation models can use a process for generating  stochasticity (e.g., randomly draw values to add to r from a  normal distribution with mean equal to r) or use observed  stochasticity by sampling a population growth dataset  randomly to calculate model parameters.
