# Part A: Overharvesting of Tropical Timber and Vertebrates  
*Define overexploitation (overharvesting/overkill/direct exploitation) and identify*  
*its estimated importance relative to the other main drivers of biodiversity loss in*  
*terrestrial vs. freshwater vs. marine systems.*  

- over-exploitation, overkill, direct exploitation
	- - do not use "over-consumption" without specifying consumption of what; specify what
- Definition: Occurs when the harvest rate of any given  population exceeds its natural replacement  rate, either through reproduction alone in  closed populations, or through both  reproduction and immigration from other  populations


Overexploitation is the leading cause of biodiversity loss in  
the world’s marine systems, and the second most  
important cause of biodiversity loss in terrestrial and  
freshwater systems


*List the two biological resources that account for the greatest dollar value of*  
*everything we harvest in legal trade, and identify the natural systems currently*  
*most affected by unsustainable harvest.*  


- two largest biological resources (LEGAL)
	- timber : 190 B
	- fisheries food products (excluding aquaculture): 81.5 B


- natural ecosystems currently most affected:
	- - marine & freshwater fisheries
	- tropical forest timber, NTFPs
		- TFP = Non-timber  forest products  E.g., Brazil nuts
	- tropical forest vertebrates


*Explain the reasons for and effects of overharvesting of tropical forest timber*  
*and vertebrates, and why there have been problems in regulating harvesting of*  
*these resources.*  

#### Timber:
- ~ 25% of global industrial wood production (2% of global  
GDP) comes from tropical forests

- Logging opens up tropical forests, makes them susceptible  to fire  
	- more wind, drying
	- more people, more ignitions
- causes habitat change - which is the highest impact on terrestrial biodiversity

- Mahogany and other high- value tropical timber spp  share several traits that  predispose them to  commercial extirpation:  
	- Excellent pliable wood of  exceptional beauty  
	- Low density populations (often < 1 tree/ha)  
	- Life histories characterized  as **non-pioneer or late  secondary****, with low-density  seedlings requiring canopy  disturbance for optimal  seedling regeneration  

Sustainable harvest would be (not done):
	Sustainable levels are also very low:  
	• cut only every 60 years  
	• harvest < 5 trees / ha  
	• leave smaller logging gaps in canopy  
	• use silvicultural techniques to plant  
	new seedlings  
	Overharvesting Timber in Tropical Forests

- Major obstacle to implementing sustainable  forestry in tropical countries is lack of financial  incentives for producers to limit off-takes to  sustainable levels and invest in regeneration

#### Hunting Tropical Forest Vertebrates
- for food, trophies, medicine, pets
- often sent to distant markets; more globalized
- Level of harvesting has increased due to changes in  hunting technology, scarcity of alternative protein,  larger numbers of people, greater access infrastructure
- Hunting rates already  unsustainably high across  vast tracts of tropical forests  
- Average of 6 fold the  maximum sustainable  harvest in Central Africa  
- Hunting can profoundly  affect structure of vertebrate  assemblages
	- however, shifting baseline problem because this has occurred for hundreds of thousands of years
	- Persistent harvesting of multispecies prey  assemblages leads to post-depletion equilibrium  conditions in which slow-breeding, vulnerable  taxa eliminated  
		- Gradually replaced by fast-breeding robust taxa that are resilient to typical offtakes


# Part B: Overharvesting of Marine Fisheries

*Identify that approximately 38% of the world’s marine fish stocks are overfished,*  
*50% are maximally sustainably fished, and 12% are underfished. Explain what these*  
*categories mean. Explain the concept of Maximum Sustainable Yield (MSY), and why*  
*it is hard to know if we are harvesting at MSY.*  

over-fished: 
- harvesting above maximum sustainable yield, and fish population shrinking maximally sustainably fished: fishing them at the level to keep them at maximum sustainable yield;
- harms reproductive capacity of the stocks
#RENR765Exam 
	**maximum sustainable yield** : any fish population will grow with **logistic growth** based on density dependence; starts slow, then goes fast, then reaches carrying capacity
	![[Pasted image 20250224123053.png]]
	- supposing this model is correct, the best population size to keep this population for growth/yield is at carrying capacity/2 == most productive for a fishery
		- however logistic growth model has not been proven
		- difficult to measure population size as well
	- should be considered an upper possible limit not what to aim for; not accurate.
	- 
under-fished: harvesting below maximum sustainable yield


*List and explain the 3 ways in which our fishing efforts have expanded globally*  
*since 1945: 
1) offshore & depth expansion,
2) geographic expansion
3) taxonomic*  *expansion.*  
	- fishing down the food web as we reduce the abundance of easier, large-bodies species
	- Demographic effect  (within-species) AND  pecies composition  change
	- effects functional traits in food webs

 *Explain how government subsidies to fisheries contribute to overcapacity and*  
*how this contributes to the depletion of fish stocks.*  
- fishing fleets deplete fish stocks (the mainstay of many countries)
- gov. provides subsidies
- increases capacity of fishing fleets (along with technological improvements)
- further depletes fishing stocks

*Identify that approximately 20% of global fish and marine invertebrate landings*  
*are the result of illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing. Discuss the difficulties*  
*in trying to tighten enforcement of marine fishing regulations.*  

- fishing is inefficient
- huge proportion of globally-fished fish; 20% roughly 
- also discards
	- IUU includes fish discarded by shrimp trawlers (usually **90%** of their actual catch)

*Identify that globally, most marine fishing capacity and landings are in the*  
*continent of Asia, but that fish exports are rising, and marine fish are sold on an*  
*international market to consumers all over the world. Identify that fish consumption*  
*in developed countries is high and rising, and that fish is an important protein*  
*source for billions of people globally.*  
- extremely important for employment in Asia
- exports have increased greatly; now stable; 
	- roughly 1/3 is for exports, mostly for human consumption
- 43% of the fish we eat comes from Asia; 26% from South and Central America
- very dependent on the protein
	- fish per capita of protein is important, especially in Asia
		- in many places >20% contribution of aquatic animal foods to animal protein supply

*List and describe the mechanisms by which overharvesting affects biodiversity.*  
*Explain concepts of fishing down the food web, trophic cascades, alternative*  
*stable states, and tipping points.*
1. **Extinction / extirpation**  
2. **Population reduction**  
	- intraspecific effects (genetic diversity, phenotypic  changes)  - on route to extinction
3. **Demographic change**  
	1. e.g. trophic level of fish species changing == trophic downgrading
	2. **Trophic Cascades**: propagation of impacts by consumers on their prey downward through food-webs
		1. the cascade is a network, not a linear chain - the one predator might not be the only thing affecting it
		2. trophic cascades are ubiquitous
			1. affects cascade: dynamics of disease, wildfire, carbon sequestration, invasive species, biogeochemical cycles
		3. Loss of apex consumers reduces food chain  length  alters intensity of herbivory and  abundance and composition of plants in largely  predictable ways  Estes et al. 2011, Science
4. **Direct and indirect effects on other species and/or abiotic environment**

 **Alternative stable states**  
	-  can be caused by any threat to biodiversity
	- The topology of ecosystem dynamics is nonlinear, resulting  in distinct ‘basins of attraction’  
	-  Alternative stable states occur when perturbations of  sufficient magnitude and direction push ecosystems from  one basin of attraction to another  

**Tipping points**  
-  Level of disturbance beyond which abrupt changes occur  in ecosystem structure and function  
- Often characterize transitions between alternative stable  states  
- Can display hysteresis (delay - kind of like extinction debt) ( = value of a physical property lags  behind changes in the effects causing it)  Estes et al. 2011, Science

**Connectivity**  
-  Species within ecosystems are connected in a complex web of interactions  
-  Every species can potentially influence many other species
- influences theories of alterative stable states, tipping points, and trophic cascades

- There is now evidence from every biome that top consumers exert top-down control on lower  trophic levels  as opposed to the idea of plants establishing ecologically states with animals being ecological passengers; animals, especially top predators are very important
- Top predators are not “ecological passengers”,  with only occasional examples of top-down  control possible to demonstrate  
- Top-down control seems fairly ubiquitous, such  that we change a lot more than a species’  population size when we overharvest top  predators


# Part C: Actions to Reduce Overharvesting  

*Describe conservation actions or activities that can be taken to reduce*  
*overharvesting, how they function to reduce overharvesting, and critique their*  
*effectiveness.*  

*there is an overestimation of marine protection when you actually look into the rules*
##### 1. Establish no-take areas (parks, marine reserves)
- allow source populations to build up
- benefits well demonstrated - reserve supply to fish in fished sink populations outside reserves
- less useful in setting where governance is poor - e.g. no fines or unexpected, incursions into no-take zones unpunished, or where subsistence hunting is the norm in that area

##### 2. When ultimate consumers are not the hunters, demand-side solutions can be tried (i.e. when the person buying the food is not hunting it - they can sway the market)
- educational programs aimed at changing consumer preferences
- wildlife/fish farms (can have unanticipated effects)


##### 3. End perverse subsidies!  
-  In response to declining fish catches, many  governments subsidize their fishing industries,  paying for huge fleets to remain in action, even  though there is less and less to fish


*Define and explain what CITES is, and discuss how effective it is at protecting*  
*species at risk of overharvesting.*
- CITES (Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora)
- by IUCN - does red-listing
- International agreement between governments aiming to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants doesn’t threaten their survival
- Most successful for species threatened by international  trade, but where economic considerations are limited  
	- Doesn’t deal well with species of high commercial value
	- more effective in pet trade than in fisheries (with high economic value)
- decision making was intensely political and found to be favoring commercial interests rather than wildlife
	- e.g. no listings for bluefin tuna and hammerhead sharks due to undue harm to countries with poor economics - but mostly harvested by large commercial vessels and not average islander


Other notes:
- Illegal wildlife trade
	- hard to get an accurate idea of
	- mammals highest, then reptiles
	- for: pet trade, eating, medicinal, scales, bones, etc.
