	# Specific Learning Objectives

Specific Learning Objectives for Lecture 5  
(Exam questions will test only these learning objectives from this lecture)  
By the end of this lecture, students should be able to:  
1) Distinguish ecosystem functions and ecosystem services. 

An **ecosystem function** is any ecosystem process.

An **ecosystem service** is an ecosystem process that *benefits people* (i.e., affects human wellbeing - provisional, cultural, supporting, regulating


Need to be able to name ecosystem services and why they are a service and not a function do not need to memorize MEA classification. 



2) Identify that the components of organismal biodiversity that relate to ecosystem  functions and services include:   
		 a) number of individuals;
		  b) species composition; 
		 c)  species traits;
		 d) number of species; 
		  e) species relative abundance, and
		 f) species  interactions.
		    
	Identify that in addition to this, 
	- population (genetic) diversity and
	- ecosystem diversity 
	also contribute to ecosystem functions and services.
	
	 
	 2b) Give  examples of how each of these components and axes of diversity can be important  for an ecosystem service, with a focus on your case study ecosystem.  See worksheet.
	
3) 
- Name the four categories of ecosystem services, as categorized by the Millennium  Ecosystem Assessment (provisioning services, cultural services, supporting  services, regulating services). 
- Give examples of specific services from each  category, 
	- and for each example, explain how biodiversity contributes to each  ecosystem service.
- For any given ecosystem service, evaluate what components of  biodiversity are most important to providing that service.  

4 Categories of ecosystem services:
1. ***provisioning services*** : **products obtained from ecosystems***
	- e.g. fuel, food, water,  biochemicals, genetic resources
2. ***cultural services*** : **nonmaterial benefits obtained from ecosystem**
	- spiritual, religious, sense of place, aesthetic, inspirational, educational, cultural heritage
3. ***supporting  services*** : **services necessary for the production of all other ecosystem services**
	- soil formation, nutrient cycling, primary production
4. ***regulating services*** : **benefits obtained from the regulation of ecosystem processes**
	- regulation of: climate, water cycles, disease, water purification, pollination, 

6) Define a ‘dominant species’. Identify that dominant species contribute the most to  ecosystem function. Be able to draw the shape of a typical species-abundance  distribution and label the axes. Explain that rare species can play a role in ecosystem  function by providing a) complementarity; b) redundancy/insurance, and c)  resistance to invasion. Explain what is meant by complementarity and  redundancy/insurance.


7) Explain that the Janzen-Connell hypothesis posits that the probability of seedling  survival increases with distance from the parent plant. Explain the mechanism.  Name the ecosystem function/service that assists seedling establishment in  situations where the Janzen-Connell hypothesized mechanism does occur.

# Additional Notes

Components of Biodiversity - from MEA 
- Number of species
- Relative abundance
- Species Composition
- Interactions
- Traits

why have all of them:
- many are overlapping, but still more information! 
	- the overlap connects categories and can provide more information than separately
- provides a complex hierarchy of the species within the ecosystem.

**Can you come up with an example for how each of these components of biodiversity contribute to a specific ecosystem function or service?** - there are 25 - good for advocating conservation for factors that are not purely intrinsic.
- number of individuals
- number of species (species richness)
- relative abundance
- composition
- interactions
- traits


### Ecosystem Services (MEA classification)

## Provisioning:
- Food
	- agricultural labor force - 22% of population
	- GDP - agriculture - 24%
-  Fuel 
		1. biofuels - wheat corn, etc.
		2. oils and fats
		3. waste crop 
		4. sawdust
		5. etc.
2. Genetic Resources
	-  important to production of food and fiber
	- wild relatives of domestic crops provide genetic variability
	-  can be crucial for overcoming outbreaks of pests, pathogens, env. stresses
	- local diversity critical factor for long term productivity and viability
		- interweaving multiple varieties - more resilient 
3. Biochemicals
	- e.g. spider venom
	- ethnobotanical knowledge - led to patenting of more than 25% of all medicines
	- modern drugs
4 . Water (in all MEA categories)
	1. freshwater cycling (regulation)
		1. e.g. complex old growth (35%+ interception) vs plantations
		2. would increase flood percentage
		3. plantation forestry does not mitigate floods and may cause them
	2. fresh water purification
		1. wetlands filter out excess nutrients and pollutants in runoff
		2. most damaging impurities come from agriculture and industry
for production with desalination - 3trillion per year
	4. fresh water provisioning (provisioning)
	5. cultural
2. Cultural Services
	1. spiritual and religious
	2. knowledge
	3. education and inspiration
	4. rec. aesthetic
	5. sense of place
3. Supporting Services
	- primary production - production of basic elements and compounds - O2
		- highest is terrestrial; but many areas in ocean with medium productivity - mostly because it is so vast - contributes to half the primary productivity in the world
			- in ocean in north and south latitudes
	- depends on number of speciess, species composition and dominant species
		- water and nutrient-limited in some places
		- cultivation is high - highly productive
	- roughly equal terrestrial and marine contributions - Oceanic 45-50 Pg C per yr
		- Marine phytoplankton often overlooked in thinking about biodiversity
			- single celled, 12 Taxonimic divisions in 3 kingdoms; dominated by cyanobacteria
		- fast-evolving
- how important is species diversity? BEF - Biodiversity and Ecosystem Function
	- many studies have shown that increased biodiversity increases primary productivity an plant communities
		- **complementarity** - different plants capture different resources
		- **Facilitation** - some species improve the environment for others
		- **Sampling effect** - the more species in an area, the more likely to have a super productive species
	- at the scale of a few 8 there is a big difference, but at higher species richness the benefits taper off
		- still offer complementarity and facilitation and **insurance***e
	- not species richness because it is the ***number of individuals of dominant species***

- provision of habitat (hard to explain as a service because how does it benefit humans?)
	- animal diversity increases with plant diversity
	- plant and fungal diversity are interdependent
- Nutrient cycling
	- carbon
	- nitrogen - fixed by cyanobacteria and symbiotic bacteria in root nodules of lichens and legumes
	- phosphorus - mycorrhizae
- Soil formation and retention
	- centuries to millennia to replace
- Invasion Resistance
	- more niches already filled, harder for non-native species to establish and have a large ecological impact
	- hold within ecosystem than between ecosystems
- Herbivory
	- maintains grasslands
	- moves seeds
	- eating herbivores
	- keeps bunchgrass from dominating supporting more fauna
- Pollination (Regulating)
	- 35% of food production depends on animal pollination
	- 87 of 115 leading global food crops
- Seed dispersal
	- allows recolonization of disturbed areas
	- allows seeds to avoid pathogens/herbivores, seed predators concentrated below parent plant
	- for 80% of plant species -esp. tropical plants
	- Janzen-Connell hypothesis: specialist plant enemies prevent seedlings recruiting near conspecific adult
	- Dispersal Syndrome - a typical method of seed dispersal that a plant seems adapted for - e.g. hooks/sticky, nutritive reward, eliaosome to attract insect dispersers
	- 60-80%
	- temperate: birds, mammals
	- tropical islands: lizards
	- tropical wet forest - vertebrates
	- dry tropical - ants
- Climate regulation
	- e.g. 10% increase in precipitation on heath lands, and 10% less on croplands
		- from albedo
	- biodiversity ocmponents: plant functional diversity, type and distro of habitat across landscapes
		- influence:
			- carbon sequestration capacity
			- albedo
			- evapotranspiration
			- tempreature
			- fire regime
- Pest Regulation
	- especially species richness
	- more-so trait richness
	- + bank of bio-control agents == insurance

- Disease Regulation
	- low densities, viruses too deadly don't spread
	- may also be a source of new diseases when human activity changes species interaction
- Natural hazard protection
	- e.g. capacity of ecosystems to buffer from extreme events, reduced through loss of wetlands, forests, mangroves
	- people increasingly occupying these exposed (to extremes) regions
	- e.g. 30 Waru trees along a 100m x 1m band reduce tsunami dimpact by 90%
- Erosion regulation
	- replacing a variety of native plants (some deep or extensive root systems) with a reduced diversity of shallow-rooted plants can increase soil erosion
	- replacing native vegetation on steep slops with agriculture or plantation forestry usually increases soil erosion
