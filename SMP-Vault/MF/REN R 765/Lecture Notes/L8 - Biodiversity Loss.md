Part A  Nothing in this part will be tested  

Part B: Biodiversity Loss  
1)a.  Explain that “biodiversity loss” comprises loss of any of the components of  biodiversity, not just species. Name these components. Also identify that  “biodiversity loss” can refer to loss of diversity per se or of specific elements of  biodiversity.

Loss - change to any **component*** (6) of biodiversity on any **axis** of biodiversity (species, genetic, ecological). All contribute to ecosystem function and loss of any will affect ecosystem function.

- extinction is a very specific kind of biodiversity - loss of last individual of a species globally
- in general it is genetic and biochemical resources that are affected by extinction, and cultural, but otherwise species affect ecosystem services less than populations - i.e. losing a population has significant impacts

- in public eye - mostly looks at charismatic ecosystems and species - misses a lot of important aspects of biodiveristy

***Conceptual pitfalls***
- loss of diversity of genes, species or ecosystems per se can be confused with the loss of a particular **element** (e.g. a species, an allele, a set of species with a traid) of that diversity

1b. Threats to Biodiversity

Threats to Biodiversity (based on MEA and IPBES)

•Habitat loss (land/sea use change)
•Overexploitation
•Pollution
•Climate change
•Invasive species

#RENR765Exam
```
For Each Threat:
•Describe its relative importance in different places
•Describe mechanisms by which it affects biodiversity
```

1c. Explain how each of these types of loss can have consequences for  ecosystem services.  


2) Explain the importance of specifying spatial scale, level of organization, and what components of biodiversity are being considered in evaluating or reporting on  biodiversity loss. 

- spatial scale and level of organization should be specified - can be increase in one scale and decrease in another spatial scale
- also describe level of organization

4) Identify that not all change to biodiversity constitutes loss. Some components of  biodiversity (like relative abundance and composition) cannot “decline”, only  “change”, so whether or not these changes are cause for concern can be complicated  to determine, and requires consideration of multiple spatial scales. 

- change is not always loss, not clearcut 
- often change in abundance - new species takes it place, so at different levels may or may not be considered a loss
- depends on objectives and values for that ecosystem
- what do we need to consider, value and manage?

5) Identify that, in general, anthropogenic effects on biodiversity constitute moving  the system from a more complex state to a simpler state.

- generalization --> biodiversity loss is a simplification
	- many species replaced with a few species
	- long food chains reduced to short food chains
	- structural complexity (trait diversity) replaced with uniform structure
