Must also maintain ecological integrity and ecosystem health --> must get specific to conserve biodiversity to heave these outcomes
	- to have measurable outcomes, must be able to define, classify and measure it better

(definitions not precise enough to act on - so must provide indicators that can be measured)
**Ecosystem health:** 
**Ecosystem Integrity:**

what is the best measure of biodiversity?

Part A  

1) *Differentiate between the characteristics of broad policy definitions of*  
*biodiversity, and scientifically measurable definitions of biodiversity.*  

- measurable definition with empirical meaning
- What is the *empirical meaning* of biodiversity, ecological integrity, ecosystem health
	- reification? can we measure these?
- biodiversity itself too vague - too many aspects to measure --> so we are diving into organismal biodiversity and not genetic and ecosystem diversity
-

2) Name and define 4 measures of ***organismal biodiversity:*** species richness,  
species diversity, species composition, and abundance of individuals. By the  
end of the lecture, be able to explain why it can be useful to measure all of these  
within the same study, rather than just one or a few.  

Language problem:
- biodiversity is often shortened to "diversity"
- Diversity can mean many things in English
- in ecology, diversity can be used in general English or in a technical sense
- be sure to be clear and precise when speaking of biodiversity

##### Measuring:

1. **Species Diversity:**
	1. Number/count of different species = *species richness*
		1. how do you compare species richness between two sites?
2. **Species Diversity:** index that combines species richness and species evenness (univariate - one number)
3.  **Species Composition** = list of species names that their relative abundances (multivariate)
		- most information
4. . (Abundance of individual)s = not a measure of diversity, but usually presented along with other diversity metrics (univariate)

General goal of conserving biodiversity - on the ground it is unclear what this means - to scientifically study, monitor, assess or compare, need empirically measurable definitions

e.g. deciding which forest management practice, deciding which land area to conserve

Part B  
3) Explain why sampling is a necessary part of biodiversity studies, what sampling bias is, why it is a problem, and how it can be avoided.

- must be feasible - focus on smaller components
- take samples in a standardized way and hope it represents an unbiased sample of total biodiversity
- what is sampling bias -
	- **unbiased** - a subsample of the whole that represents the composition of the whole perfectly in proportion
	- **biased** - a subsamples of the whole that does not proportionally represent the composition of the whole

goal: use species richness samples from two populations and compare

Measuring 

Read Gotelli and Colwel ch.4 - composition and richness - free from library

1) Identify that observed species richness is a downward-biased estimator for true species richness, and explain why this is the case.  
2) 
Species richness is downward-biased - we are *never finished sampling* to get a picture of the species richness - e.g. not even after 30 years in the rainforest

Methods to counter:
- standardize by sampling effort
- standardize by area sampled - CANNOT STANDARDIZE - must be exactly the same area compared across two sites
	- also multiple quadrats should be *separated by the same distances* - otherwise more different species in farther quadrats
to compare - the two areas compared must always be exactly the same - i.e. CANNOT standardize with methods below (see below - standardization by area )

Issues with species richness sampling:
1. relationship between number of individuals and number of species
2. relationship between sample area and number of species
i.e. species richness not independent of the other variables - confounded.


How to sample for comparison:
- same size of quadrats
- same distance between quadrats
	- otherwise could take the mean per quadrats instead of totals from each quadrats

4) Explain how the curvature of the Species Area Relationship makes interpretation  of species richness measures non-independent from the area from which they were  measured. Explain how we can control for this to make different measurements  comparable in studies comparing biodiversity between locations.  

- Non-linearity of the species area curve is the issue
- As you increase the area you find more species but it is a curved relationship with diminishing returns
	- one of ecology's few genuine laws

species richness vs. density
- density = number/area
	- but if you do that here the estimate changes with the area with a non-linear relationship
	- ![[Pasted image 20250110123512.png]]




6) Explain how the curvature of the general species accumulation curve makes interpretation of species richness measures non-independent from the number of individuals sampled. Explain how we can control for this to make measurements from samples with different numbers of individuals comparable.  

- problem: non-linearity of species accumulation curve
- how to compare between sites in a robust way?
	
- Rarified: the average number of species encountered after examining the same number of individuals from each site
	- randomly draw the same number many times - then calculate the average each time
- then use values of species richness for same number of individuals on rarefaction curve


8) Explain the difference between a species accumulation curve and a rarefaction curve. Explain what each of these allows us to determine.

Rarefaction curve:
- rarified species curve plots species richness for all possible numbers of individuals sub-sampled from the sample, up to the total number of individuals sampled

•Rarefaction = re-sampling our sample a large number of times (≥ 100) and drawing re-sampled species accumulation curves each time

•Then calculate the average number of species detected for each number of individuals sampled, across all these re-samplings

•This creates a smoothed curve representing the average rate of accumulation of species as individuals are re-sampled for that sample (a rarefaction curve)


Rarefaction is average of all possible species of accumlation you could draw, a species accumulation curve is one of the many ways it could be sub-sampled.


Species Accumulation Curve
- •A species accumulation curve is one re-sampling of our sample

•Is only one re-sampling a reliable indication of:

–A) the number of species for a given number of individuals at that site?

–B) whether our curve has plateaued?

•What if we had re-sampled the individuals in a different order?


![[Pasted image 20250110125004.png]]
Rarefaction is the purple curve - the average

***Rarefaction curve allows us to estimate the species richness when the rarefaction curve plateaus.***

8) Recognize or draw the shape of a rarefaction curve for a completely sampled  community. Recognize or draw the shape of a rarefaction curve for an incompletely sampled community. Be able to label the axes of these curves. Explain why it is  better to assess whether sampling is complete from a rarefaction curve than from a species accumulation curve.  


10) Explain what an asymptotic richness estimator is, and how and why they work.
- to estimate true total species richness rather than comparing two
- when it has not plateaued to determine species richness use asymptotic estimate - adds a term based on the number of singletons, doubletons, or a few individuals
- not precise - wavers up and down
- but after 20+ individuals it looks like it is fairly accurate
- Can then use a way smaller sample and get an estimate of the true total species
- SChao1 - abundance data:
	- works because of species abundance distribution always follows the same distribution
	- accuracy vs. plateaued rarefied species richness curve works really well when compared to empirically validated data
![[Pasted image 20250113120947.png]]
- SChao2 - for ?? data ??

NOTE: species density not generally reported because the species-area relationship would need to be known

### Other Measures of Diversity than species richness
--> next term is "Species diversity" as another metric of species diversity with diversity metrics:
	"species diversity" - specific meaning - a quantitative number

#### Part C  
10) Explain the purpose of using a species diversity index instead of species richness to compare species diversity between samples. List the measurable  variables that are used to calculate diversity indices.  
One number (index) that is a function of two:
1. number of species present (S)
2. Evenness of abundance among species (inverse = dominance)
	

4) Define species evenness and species dominance.  
	1) 1. even - all species present in equal abundance
	2) one or more species are more abundance relative to others

6) Name the two most widely used diversity indices. Know which one gives higher weight to rare species. Be able to rank species richness, Shannon diversity, and  Simpson’s diversity in the relative weight that they give to rare species.
- some indices behave in more intuitive ways than others; and they have different ways to define them (for the same index!)
1. Simpson's Index D
2. Shannon's Index H

###### Simpon's Index:

##### Shannon's Index
![[Pasted image 20250113122056.png| 400]]


4) Explain why Hill numbers are preferable to other diversity index formulations.  
- Proposed a unified concept of diversity so there is a continuum of possibly diversity measures - can be thought of as **effective number of species
- puts all indices in the same units
	- number of species at equal abundance to produce that level of diversity
- Hill numbers ("effective number of species):
	- share a common set of intuitive mathematical properties, and behave as one would expect of a diversity index whereas raw indices to not


6) Define what Hill’s “effective numbers of species” means. (Number of equally abundant species necessary to produce the observed value of diversity.)  
**Effective number of species:** **the number of equally abundant species necessary to produce the observed value of diversity***  (analogous to effective population size in genetics)
- units comparable across different Hill number metrics
N0 = number of species (not considering evenness) - Chao "good for diversity of rare species"
N1 = exponential Shannon index (considering evenness and even of the rare species) - Chao "diversity of typical species"
N2 = Simpson Index (considering evenness and heavily weighting dominant species) - Chao "diversity of dominant species"
(*most useful N0 to N2*)
Dinf = Berger-Parker index
(as value of a increases increasing value of weight on dominant species on diversity

(on eClass)

8) Identify that diversity indices suffer from the same biases as species richness estimates, but to a lesser extent, because species richness is only part of what  determines the value of the index, and evenness is not biased in the same way by  sample area or number of individuals sampled.
- the suffer but not to such an extreme extent
- standardization to prevent bias is still required
	- keep sample area constant
	- Rarefaction is most often not done for diversity indices, but is should be, because your estimate of "true" diversity will change with the number of individuals sampled



![[Pasted image 20250113123802.png]]
formula same as above but a replaced with q and written differently - showing Rarefaction using Hill number for indices - see where they  plateau - controlling for number of sample bias becomes less necessary with increased weighting of evenness (higher Hill number) as evenness is not affected by that bias.
