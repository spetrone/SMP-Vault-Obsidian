- largely its interaction/extra stress to other distrubances
- ranked 3/4 - less than habitat change, overfishing, etc.


1. Identify/report the qualitative (directional) trends in global CO2 levels, global  
surface temperature, sea heat, Arctic and Antarctic ice mass, and sea level.  
- sharp increase now from trend
- difficult to track , but can now monitor from space 
- Summer Arctic sea ice extent is shrinking by 12.6% per  decade as a result of global warming.  
- Sea ice loss- losing more old sea ice (greater percentage of ice being lost is sea ice)
	- antarctica - 151 metric tons/yr
	- greenland - 273 metric tons/yr

2. Identify the two mechanisms causing sea level rise: ice sheet melting and water  
volume expansion as sea heat increases. Identify that ice sheet melting is thought to  
have contributed twice as much to sea level rise over the past 30 years.  

- Sea ice loss- losing more old sea ice (greater percentage of ice being lost is sea ice)
	- antarctica - 151 metric tons/yr
	- greenland - 273 metric tons/yr
- melting of glaciers and large ice masses
	- measure by >3000 floating sensors and satellite methods
- thermal expansion - warmed water expands


- heat increases
	- increasing constantly
	- increasing most in arctic region
	- argo fleet - provided vastly more knowledge about temp, density, salinity and chemistry for ocean observation

detection methods: mass increase, sea level trend, thermal expansion trend


3. Identify already-observed consequences of climate change for biodiversity as:  
coral reef bleaching and death, and species distribution shifts.  


- coral reef bleaching - result of increased ocean temperature
	- Corals sicken and expel the symbiotic algae  that would normally live inside their bodies  and provide them with essential  carbohydrates  
	- Bleached corals often die from starvation  
	


4. Explain what corals are, including what kind of animal they are, that they have an  
almost completely obligate interaction with dinoflagellate/zooxanthellae species,  
and describe coral anatomy and colony structure. Identify that there are hundreds  
of species of coral. Explain why corals and their interaction with zooxanthellae are  
functionally important in marine ecosystems, and why climate change effects on this  
interaction have far-reaching knock-on effects.  

- Corals = Phylum Cnidaria, Class  Anthozoa  
		- Part animal, part algae, part stone  
		-  Most corals obtain the majority of their energy and nutrients from photosynthetic unicellular dinoflagellates of the genus Symbiodinium that live within  their tissues (commonly known is zooxanthellae); can make up  30% of the tissue of a polyp  
		- can share resources between corals - coenosarc
- extremely sensitive to sea heating
	- 1.5 C - 10-90% of coral reefs will vanish
	- 2C - 99% of coral reefs will vanish
- Cover less than 0.1% of the ocean floor  
- Shallow, tropical areas around the world = some of most  crucial habitat in the ocean  
- Up to 25% of marine animals rely on reefs for their survival  
- Form basis of food chain; provide structure  


5. Explain what coral bleaching is, what causes it, whether it is reversible, and how it  
can lead to coral death.  
- -coral reef bleaching - result of increased ocean temperature HEATING
	- Corals sicken and expel the symbiotic algae  that would normally live inside their bodies  and provide them with essential  carbohydrates  
	- Bleached corals often die from starvation  
	- bleaching is because dynoflagellates provide colour and when expelled they look bleached - they are white without the dynoflagellates
		- then they die because they do not have their energy source
		- more sensitive to other stressors - that may be cause of death
		- then they become a structure and get covered in algae
- several global events: 1998, 2002, 2010 June 2014-April 2017 - more than 80% of the earth's seas experience conditions associated with mortality
	- - many have recovered/partially recovered but 50% expected to have died
- 2020
- 2022

- bleaching events are expected to increase - heating expected to increase in oceans causing these events
	- expected that half coral reefs expected to experience bleaching during the 2030's 
	- even worse in 2050's


6. Explain how rising CO2 levels lead to ocean acidification, and what the  
consequences of ocean acidification are for shell-forming invertebrates and for  
stony corals.  

- when CO2 dissolved, seawater becomes more acidic
- ocean absorbs 27% of CO2 from atmospher
	- decreases pH, reduces carbonate available for shells  which they need to preciptate the mineral aragonite to build cytoskeletons- impacts shell-forming marine organisms - e.g. oysters, clams, stony corals,
- 2 pronged attack on coral - because growth is made more difficult from the acidity reducing carbonate
- aragonite decreasing with CO2 increases

coral conservation:
- reduce land-based sources of pollution
- educate communities on sustainable fishing practices
- identify reef at risk of bleaching
- mitigate effects of disease and changing ocean conditions with in-reef resotration projects, with a focus on resilience


7. Identify that climate-related species distribution shifts have been observed  
and/or are expected to occur in upward and poleward directions. Explain how  
climate-related species distribution shifts can occur because of changes to abiotic  
habitat variables that affect species’ survival, or distribution shifts of other species  
that constitute a focal species’ “habitat”, or because of direct climate effects on a  
species’ reproduction.


(a) distribution shifts - tropics
- Effects of global climate change on temperature  and rainfall expected to have particularly  dramatic effects in the tropics  
	- tropical plants are more sensitive to climatic shifts
- Many tropical species and biological communities appear to have narrow tolerances for temperature and rainfall, so even small changes in climate could have major effects on species  composition, cycles of plant reproduction,  patterns of migration, etc.  
- for vegetation
	- distribution shifts from abiotic factors /climate drivers
		- water availability, cloudiness, temperature
	- - at community level - no long term changes
	- with new recuits: 
		- Findings: Amazon tree communities have become  increasingly dominated by large-statured taxa. To date no  change in mean wood density or water deficit affiliation at  the community level  
	- Among new recruits, dry-affiliated genera have become  more abundant  
	- Mortality of wet-affiliated genera has increased in plots where dry season has intensified the most  
	- Slow shift to a more dry-affiliated Amazonia is underway,  but as yet no significant change to whole-community composition
- fauna
	- vegetation shifts
	- direct responses to climate variables
	- sea ice loss - loss of habitat for harp seals, polar bears, walruses
	- sea level rise -> 25-80% of coastal wetlands could be altered within 10 years
	- temperature and precipitation changes -> boreal forest expected to become fragmented
	- in general, species distributions shifting poleward and upware (usually a reduction in range size)
		- effects population size, genetic diversity (same as habitat change an land use consequences)
	- effects on reproduction (demographic shifts - e.g. in sex)
		- Some reptiles and teleost fish have  temperature-dependent sex determination 
		- Egg temperature in the middle third of  embryonic development (thermosensitive  period, TSP) determines sex  
		- Temperature pulses during the TSP are often  not enough to determine sex
		- nesting - e.g. turtles having eariler and longer nesting seasons - correlatd with warmer sea surface temperatures in loggerhead sea turtles
			- already female-biased in southern US, and likely to become extremely biased with as little as 1C
				- extreme levels of mortality expected if warming exceeds 3C
			- possible mitigation : put sun shelters over sea turtle nests



(b) climate shifts - poleward
