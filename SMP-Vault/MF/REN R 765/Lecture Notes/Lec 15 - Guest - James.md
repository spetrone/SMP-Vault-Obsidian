1) Identify that the half-moon hairstreak is an endangered butterfly species in  
Canada, restricted to a 3 km2 area in Waterton Lakes National Park, and that it is  
very genetically distinct from half-moon hairstreak populations elsewhere (BC and  
the western USA).  


2) Describe activities that the Wilder Institute, in collaboration with Parks Canada,  
is doing to meet the recovery objectives for this species under Canada’s endangered  
species legislation, including:  

• Assessing critical habitat (what does this include?)  
- Waterton Lakes - 50% burned in 2017
- grassy area 3km2 around river/creek and lake - the only place you find it anywhere within 400 km
	- down to 1.5 km2 after fire
	- natural disasters could completely decimate the population
	- campsites and horse trails around, even though in national park 
		- spotted knappweed - invasive plant - produces 50k-100k seeds

how - set up transects and walk them - 198 lines considered half moon habitat
take tablet and mark down measurements
	- e.g. the halfmoons eat lupids, so they measured lupins
	- - mapping out plants:
		- lupins - silvery and silky - more on one than the other
		- nectar plant - Buckwheat
	- ground cover in quadrats to check for where larvae are located, and mapping it out


• Population monitoring (how is this done?)  
	- larvae
		- quadrats to map groundcover and see where larvae occur
			- find:
				- host plant associations
				- host ant associations
				- other behaviours
		-  found:
			- silvery lupines are the main food plant (99%)
			- 200% association with ants Lasius ponderosae - live in roots of lupins, farm aphids and halfmoons on the lupins; in return the larvae exude honeydew - but they lace it with slightly addictive chemicals to ants that amp them up
			- will use ants nests for refuge
			- larvae use ant galleries to shelter in hot temperatures like at 35+
	- they need a stable, older environment with more mature plants
	- inversely related to spotted gnapweed (the invasive species) so this does have an impact


Adult surveys
- distance surveys along transects
- observations of behaviour
	- perching
	- mating
	- nectaring
	- egg-laying
- density mapping
	- - center of density changes every year
		- may be indication of larvae having an impact on lupins
	- informs spotted knapweed control

- also in-human care experiements
	- previously could only capture for 24 hours - but they would not move for the entire tie when put in a cage
	- decided to turn up temp, and keep for longer, last year, direct sunlight, got two eggs laid
- eggs laid at base of lupins at ant nests 
	- need to alter variables to get in human-care eggs

- did WGS on the butterflies
	- could show if  wild-to-wild translocations are possible, if genomes are similar


- low heterozygosity - has been like this for a long time
	- estimated genetic population of ~1000 individuals
	- one of the most homozygous populations of any known animal on the planet (similar to the florida panther)
- separated from other populations for at least 40,000 years

• Species distribution modelling (SDM) to predict habitat suitability beyond  
the Blakiston Fan in Waterton Lakes National Park  
- looking for ecological divergence - the Albera one is very ecologically differentiated
	- isolated
	- ecologically diverged
	- genetically unique
	- separated by 40,000
	- THEREFORE ITS OWN SPECIES - not a subspecies
- used to predict where a species will be located based on ecological zones
	- the Alberta population is outside its ecological zone
- 



• Habitat restoration 
- removal of invasive spotted knapweed
- biological controls - two species of weavel that eats seeds and roots of knapweed
- keep modelling habitat to manage the small area

• Initiating study of captive rearing techniques for ex-situ conservation and  
population augmentation

	- where and why are they using landscape
	- where and why are the larvae using the landscape?
	- collect genetic samples
	- investigate translocation/rearing techniques
