- first and only global assessments of biodiversity
- best information on big picture 
	- review of all existing literature (as exhaustive as possible)
	- engaged global and multi-sectoral participation
	- tried to reduce regional bias - scientific output is different between countries
	- IPBES - also strove for disciplinary and cultural inclusivity



# Specific Learning Objectives
Part A – Introduction to MEA and IPBES  
1.  Identify the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) and the IPBES Report as  
the largest global assessments of the current knowledge, scientific literature, and  
data on the state of biodiversity and ecosystem services locally, regionally, and  
globally, and their importance for human wellbeing.

Tele-coupling: mechanisms by which regional, provincial, national and continental activities can impact global processes
	e.g. tourism, trade, political agreements
	- can be negative or positive
	- e.g. tourism-  wealthy traveling to poor locations
	- e.g. trade - global agricultural trade focuses on cash crops - rather than a large variety of agriculture of what the local population needs
	- e.g. economics - multi-nationals and taxation/rules vary from country to country - base in country with least restrictions and most favorable tax rules. For example, Canada has a huge proportion of world's mining companies - 75% of world's mining companies based in Canada, 42B of GDB -   one of most important sectors
		- huge global environmental impacts, including overseas, that Canadians are not aware of.

- we want global-scale outcomes - need to be able to prioritize actions to achieve those
	- climate change mitigation
	- slowing spread of species
	- marine ecosystem function
	- reducing anthropogenic extinctions
	- maintain genetic diversity of domesticated species (within global agricultural system)


Why regional and multi-sectorial
- reduce bias (regional and cultural)
	- scientific output greater in global North
- different knowledge on different issues and potential solutions
	- scientists, ENGOS, industry, gov, Indigenous
	- e.g. Indigenous people align more with biodiversity conservation and anything damaging to them is also probably damaging to biodiversity
- cultural inclusivity : embody different ways of knowing and diversity of ways of being human - valuable perspectives on complex issues
- it is through disciplines other than natural sciences that we understand man of the social system components of our complex Earth system


BOTH MEA and IPBES
- review of existing literature and data
- consultation with diverse stakeholders
- review and comment by experts
- global synthesis based on regional reports

WHY BEST?
- normal scientific and academic publishing suffes from:
	- sensationalism
	- cultural bias
	- regional bias
	- gender bias

```
It is impossible for one or a small group of scientists doing an exhaustive review of the literature to get as good a picture as we have gotten from the methods of MEA and IPBES
```


### What to take out of readings (read either):

•Great source of stats on trends – because of global coverage and extensive expert review before publication

•Trustworthy “baseline” findings against which to compare interpretations of more limited-scale studies

•Great source of ideas and foci for conservation practitioners, researchers, policy-makers, industry & ENGO leaders


### Difference
MEA - big budget, 
**IPBES** - more up-to-date

## Summary
•MEA (2005) was the first large global-scale assessment of the status of biodiversity, its value for humanity, threats, and recommended actions to mitigate those threats

•IPBES (2019) was the second assessment, for the purpose of updating the info in the MEA and including other knowledge and value systems, in particular those of indigenous peoples

•These reports are valuable because of their global scope and participation, and the amount of scientific data considered in their production

2) Explain the value of global assessments in planning and prioritizing biodiversity  conservation actions.  
 
 
 
 3) Explain the value of multisectoral participation and disciplinary and cultural  inclusivity in global assessments on biodiversity and ecosystem services.  



4) Describe the value of global assessments of this scale in revealing where there is  scientific consensus, versus where important controversies remain.  


Part B – Millennium Ecosystem Assessment  
5) Articulate the objectives of the MEA  
	1) •Establish scientific basis for actions needed to enhance conservation and sustainable use of ecosystems and their contributions to meeting human needs
		1. Provide authoritative info to address specific policy questions
		2. Clarify where there are areas of broad consensus within scientific community and where important controversies remain
		3. Provide insights that emerge from a broad review of knowledge that might not appear from individual studies

1) Briefly describe the methods by which the MEA was produced.  
-  Assessed current knowledge, scientific literature, and data

**Experts and Review Process**
- Prepared by 1360 experts from 95 countries
- 80-person independent board of review editors
- Review comments from 850 experts and governments

**Governance**
- Authorized by governments through 4 conventions
- Partnership of UN agencies, conventions, business, non-governmental organizations with a multi-stakeholder board of directors

Multi-scale approach with 33 sub-global assessments - so there is still some regional bias
- e.g. Canada: https://www.millenniumassessment.org/en/SGA.Canada.html 

4 working groups:

**Describe the important new contributions from the MEA.**  

1. Humans are fundamentally and irreversibly changing Earth’s biodiversity
2. This is a problem because biodiversity has intrinsic value and also supports human well-being by providing 28 ecosystem services
3. There are 5 direct and 5 indirect drivers of biodiversity loss
4. We are already taking some action, but unprecedented efforts will be needed to achieve, by 2010, a significant reduction in rate of biodiversity loss

NEW contributions:
•Focus on ecosystem services and their link to human well-being and development needs was unique and derived new importance (related to humans)

•Put the findings in a form that decision-makers could weigh alongside other social and economic information

1. **The balance sheet:** 60% of a group of 24   ecosystem services are being degraded

2.  **Drylands**. Because MEA focuses on linkages between ecosystems and human well-being, a somewhat different set of priorities emerge
	1. for biodiversity AND reliance of people on biodiversity

3. **Nutrient loading.** It is already well-recognized that climate change and habitat loss are immediate threats
	1. MEA found that excessive nutrient loading is one of major change drivers, but was not receiving significant policy attention in many countries or internationally

- reports on uncertainties - problematic at local and national scales - insufficient information on full economic costs and benefits of alternate uses of ecosystems to fully inform decisions
`Importantly, MEA reports uncertainty about all findings, quantitatively where possible, and otherwise qualitatively`

2) Explain the purpose of the “scenarios” described in the MEA.  
- not predictions - scenarios are plausible futures
- both quantitative models and qualitative analysis used in scenario development
- Present conditions and trends --> reactive and proactive approaches axes, regionalized or globalized transitions/organization
	- gave names to scenarios along these two axes
#RENR765Exam - we will have to write a scenario for our ecosystem


- Scenario Storylines: global orchestration, order from strength, adapting mosaic, technogarden in "quadrants" of scenario axes

RESPONSES - what can we do to prevent further biodiversity loss

Part C – IPBES  - read summary for policymakers

9) Explain the function of the IPBES report in relation to the MEA. Identify  
differences in participation and the conceptual framework used in producing the  
IPBES report as compared to the MEA  

- increasing participation 95 - 135 countries?
-
**Objective:** •Provide governments, the private sector, and civil society with scientifically credible and independent up-to-date assessments of available knowledge for better evidence-informed policy decisions and action at the local, national, regional, and global levels
***nearly same as MEA***

why do again after MEA:
- Substantial increase in our understanding of biodiversity and ecosystems and their importance to human quality of life since MEA (2005)

- Recognized need to incorporate social science perspectives, a range of knowledge systems and additional dimensions of value

- More biodiversity loss has occurred since 2005

10) Describe the new contributions of the IPBES report and its value for  conservation practitioners relative to MEA

- more symmetric and fuller world view

```
•More precision and detailed understanding
  
- Incorporates IPCC climate change models and predictions into projections for biodiversity and drivers of biodiversity loss

• Emphasizes importance of indigenous land  
management knowledge, practices and issues - much bigger step in that direction than MEA ; Found 1/4 of land owned by Indigenous people - and that land has deteriorated less

• More precision and detailed understanding 

• MEA predicted that climate change and nutrient  pollution would rapidly increase in importance as drivers of biodiversity loss  15 years later, land/sea use change and overexploitation are still  
more important
(but they are not - but land and sea use change and exploitation are)
```

- ha**s responses** - longer reports - that are more specific, and have approaches to respond


```Summary
PBES 2019 report aimed to provide an update to the  MEA, but incorporating a broader knowledge base,  
with emphasis on indigenous and local knowledge  

• Large review of scientific literature and indigenous and  local knowledge, with participation of diverse stakeholders  

• Replaced the Ecosystem Services framework of the  MEA with a Nature’s Contributions to People  framework  

• Same storyline of the findings as MEA

• Value is in the updated information, better estimates of uncertainty, more specific recommendations for actions, and recognition of the importance of indigenous land management for many of our remaining natural areas
```



•MEA predicted that climate change and nutrient pollution would rapidly increase in importance as drivers of biodiversity loss à 15 years later, land/sea use change and overexploitation are still more important

``` MEA SUMMARY
•MEA aimed to establish the scientific basis for actions needed to enhance conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity

•First global assessment of biodiversity status, trends, drivers of loss, and necessary conservation actions to prevent further loss

•Incorporated global and sub-global assessments

•Highlighted accelerating biodiversity loss, 5 most important direct and 5 indirect drivers of loss, and that unprecedented efforts would be needed to reverse trends

•Highlighted drylands as a priority from the human perspective

•Highlighted nutrient pollution as driver of unrecognized importance
