### Species Diversity

**species richness** : the number of species in a given area

**alpha diversity** : number of species in a specific location
**beta diversity**: how species composition changes across space
**gamma diversity**: overall number of species across a broad region

^ all correlated

Diversity of *traits* matters to community via:
- functional roles
- habitat use
- life history strategy (e.g. # offspring, lifespan)
- behavioral traits (e.g. herding, solitary, migratory, stationary)


***Rarity*** - 3 possibilities:
1. low population densities
2. uncommon habitat types
3. very localized range

**endemic**: a species with a restricted range (not by size, but only one geographic location)


### Genetic Diversity
- arise from genetic mutations (insertions, deletions, inversions, duplications(repeats), translocations) , exon shuffling, & transposable elements
- natural selection and changing environments forces populations to have variation in genes to more quickly adapt (rate of mutation would not be enough)
- **Populations** : groups of individuals that live in a particular geographical area and normally breed with one another
	- different selective pressures cause localized genetic differences; over time with isolation, new species can develop.
- **Gene flow**: interbreeding causing the movement of genes between population

### Ecosystem Diversity 

**ecosystem**: group of interacting organisms and the physical environment they inhabit
- not discrete entities, gradual boundaries in response to environmental gradients
	- scales of gradients:
		- broad: regional climate and physical features
		- intermediate scales: soils, topography large-scale disturbance (e.g. fire, insects)
		- local scale: biotic interactions, small-scale disturbances, microclimate
**community**: living members of an ecosystem
*3 main attributes*: 
1. composition: individual elements that comprise the system, such as species.
2. structure: how elements are arranged in 3D space (e.g. horizontal and vertical structure of a forest), + relative abundance and distribution of species
3. function: various processes that occur within the system - both biotic (e.g. competition) and abiotic (e.g. nutrient cycling)

**Succession** : the process by which the mix of species and habitat in an area changes over time

**Natural Disturbances** - e.g. fires, insect outbreaks, storms, droughts, etc. --> affection succession 

**Anthropogenic Disturbances**: of human origin, especially those with no natural analog - can *disrupt* ecosystems and cause species to *decline*
