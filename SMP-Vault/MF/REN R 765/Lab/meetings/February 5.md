here is a problem 


- methods

- selecting plots
	- certain age
	- certain species
		- e.g. conifer dominant over x% conifer
	- no disturbances
	- spatial
	- ecoregion?
- wetland 
- systematic sampling:
	- take overall region
	- filter by variables described above ^
	- label plots by structural diversity first?
	- maximize variance
	- then  maximize variance of distance between plots?

- structural diversity ideas:
	(1) make index
	(2) ordination 
	(3) use ordination to make specific index to lichens
	(4) make multiple indices
	- factors?


- Tests of significance

- set threshold for 
- coefficient of variation of the predictor variable
	- search for spatial patterns in structural complexity
	- don't need to put in proposal


Plan is complete
- their sampling plan
- how data are collected
- summarize 


MANOVA or PERMANOVA or nNMDs
