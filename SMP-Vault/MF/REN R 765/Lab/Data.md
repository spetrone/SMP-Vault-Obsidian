## ABMI Site Data
- within 5.5 km radius -> makes cross-checking with map/lidar/ data difficult
	- specifically for cross-checking disturbances

## Vegetation
- type of trees --> should I stipulate coniferous-only vs. mixed? 

## Physical Structure 
- downed logs
- snags 

## Disturbances

- *if not doing a time series, how will I determine the age of the disturbance*
- e.g. 20 years
	- it *should* be reported in the ABMI data as a disturbance
	- there should be harvest mapping data and fire mapping data with the age - so cross-check that with the 5.5KM r around ABMI site?
	- 

datasets:
- Site disturbance
- Surface Substrate Disturbance
- Soil Disturbance
- Moss Lichen Disturbance
- Dimensional Cover Disturbance

### 1. Wildfire
*How can I ensure that it is a stand-replacing fire/severe class III fire?*

- Site Disturbance
- Surface Substrate Disturbance:
	- - disturbance code == FIRE
	- disturbance % >= 100% (or a lower cut off? 85-90%+)
- Soil Disturbance
	- disturbance code == FIRE
	- disturbance % >= 90% (or a lower cut off? 85-90%+)
- Moss Lichen Disturbance
	- disturbance code == FIRE
	- disturbance % >= 90% (or a lower cut off? 85-90%+)



### 2. Harvest (Logging)
*How can I ensure that it is clear-cut logging?*
