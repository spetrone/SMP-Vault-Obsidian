(1) Determine measures of structural diversity - exactly which ones to use
(2) find those in ABMI data
	- possibly see what is in NFI to make index with overlapping variables
(3) report on the variables from ABMI data
	- table with: measurement method & plot size / spatial relation to lichen plots


(4) Determine method of making structural diversity inde
