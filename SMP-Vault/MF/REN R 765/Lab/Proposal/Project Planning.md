Hypothesis:

Stand-replacing crown fires affect species richness  and species composition differently than clear-cut logging in the boreal forest in Northern Alberta.

Prediction
There will be different levels of species richness and different levels of species composition of lichens in boreal forests, between areas affected by clearcut logging vs. stand-replacing wildfire disturbances 20 years post-disturbance (possibly could do time series). 

This is because of the different  vegetation dynamics and soil dynamics between mixed vs. coniferous forests, and between burned, and logged forests affecting the physical habitat (such as shade, moisture, temperature, humidity, habitat structure and arrangement, etc.) and the biogeochemical environment (SOM, nutrient cycling, acidity, microbial species composition, etc.). 


- May also look into relative abundance of rare, typical and dominant bryophyte species.

- areas in FMAs
	- find undisturbed that are loggable 
- ABMI papers - do not re-do 
- ask Charles
	- where to get harvest data?
- John Stadt - harvest data
- Forestry seminar - Gord 
- Diane Haughland 
	- ask for lichen 
	- hoping to publish it
	- wondering if we could meet
		- pass idea by her
		- maybe collaborate 
- Jen Beverly - fire data 
- interactions
	- burned - salvage logging
	- burning after harvest - surface fire
		- talk to Jen about 
- email ABMI or ask Diane who to ask
- email Gord

Data to look up:
1. undisturbed area (probably fine)- and look for pre-disturbed options for 2 & 3 below
2. logged areas - from ABMI data and cross check with harvest map? how accurate?
3. wildfire affected areas from ABMI data and cross-check with wildfire map?
	1. how to ensure it was a stand-replacing fire?
4. Lichen and Moss classification databases

Questions to consider:
1. look at undisturbed or pre-disturbance data
	- what is difference in statistics of using a pre-disturbance vs. a different "treatment" area for undisturbed
2. pick one "type" of boreal forest - i.e. mixed vs coniferous, dominant species?
3. Do I need to break up species into sub-classes? For species composition?
	- e.g. sub-classes:
		- mosses: 
			- e.g. light vs shade
		- lichen classifications
			1. Lignicolous - Lichens that live in wooded areas.
			2. Corticolous - Lichens that live on tree bark.
			3. Saxicolous - Lichens that live on stones or rocks.
			4. Marine - Lichens that grow on siliceous rocks near the sea.
			5. Freshwater - Lichens that grow on hard siliceous rocks near freshwater.
			6. Terricolous - Lichens that grow on soil, also known as terrestrial lichens.
4. Can I do an analysis on rare vs. typical species

- not riparian
- not mandatory 15%
- what is the sweetspot for operational retention?
	- what is the cutoff 
	- mixedwood or pure aspen
- island retention not as much of a question
	- know how it should work
	- island retention doesn't blow over as much
- want to get away from operational retention - they often don't hit their target e.g. 5% or 20% - not hitting threshold - left in the hands of the operators
- age: mixedwood 90 yr west FMA
- more mixedwoods west FMA
- pick 50-70 ha
- 30 - 100 ha have similar retention with round shapes

- data does exist on individual tree point retention and island retention + models that tell you what species
