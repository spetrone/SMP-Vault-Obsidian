Analyses of forest structural diversity have relied on not only a variety of variables but also a variety of indices based on those variables.  Because diversity assesses variability by definition, indices based on the distributions of tree attributes are both intuitive and logical. For categorical variables such as tree species, indices based on simple counts or proportions are reasonable, although accommodation for rare or clustered species may be necessary. For continuous variables such as DBH, indices based on distributions are reasonable ([Neumann and Starlinger 2001](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/X07-154?casa_token=PG6z3yZ2GPwAAAAA%3A6ekcLwkFnYPGRuUQRKhSOvQp3mcXdfkFp05J4uhi8hsftjm03TVbLLyZO22envTsjGkQ6Nt4HwZj#core-ref30)).

- is there data for horizontal structure?

### WHY
The Society of American Foresters ([SAF 1991](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/full/10.1139/X07-154?casa_token=PG6z3yZ2GPwAAAAA%3A6ekcLwkFnYPGRuUQRKhSOvQp3mcXdfkFp05J4uhi8hsftjm03TVbLLyZO22envTsjGkQ6Nt4HwZj#core-ref40)) notes that “because the definition of biological diversity is expansive, progress in conservation efforts is most often accomplished when discussions focus on specific components of biological diversity.”


# look into
- forest canopy effects on long-wave radiation and lichen
- microclimate from forest structure
	- moisture
	- cloud drip
	- sublimation
	- etc.
