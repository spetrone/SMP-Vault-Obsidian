- Title /1  
• Mentions predictor and response variables  
• Adequately describes what the study is about  

Introduction /15  
• Background information, including references to the primary literature (starting  broadly, then getting more specifically related to your study system)  
- (1) structural diversity and biodiversity (not lichen specific)
- lichen biodiversity
	- known drivers of lichen biodiversity
• Introduces importance of the predictor variables with references from the literature  
- what is structural diversity?
- how is it measured?
- how has it been used?
	
• Final paragraph that states the specific objectives (or questions), and for each  objective/question, the hypothesis.  
- how does structural diversity of boreal forests affect biodiversity of lichens?
	- species richness
	- species diversity 
	- species relative abundance
	- species composition
	- alpha/beta diversity?
	-
• Contains a statement of the general expectations of outcomes from the proposed research.  
(prediction?)
e.g. In stands with high levels of structural diversity (describe parameters specifically), there will be higher levels of species richness and species diversity

Materials and Methods /15  
• How are the data being collected and how will you analyse them to answer your  question?  

Data collection:
- ABMI sampling
- plot selection
- selecting variables
- what variables kept the same 

Methods:
- (1) measuring and quantifying structural diversity
	- 

• Detailed enough that another person could read this section and repeat your  methods exactly at a later time (look to journal articles to get a sense of how much  detail to be using)  
• Include information (as relevant) in the following order on:  

o Field site selection  
- do I need to have decided on my plots? Could I define the parameters of my plots? I want to be able to play around with this a little bit

o Data collection (methods, dates, times, details of equipment used if relevant).  You must describe how both the predictor and response variables were  
measured.  

o Analysis (metrics, calculations, statistical tests used). You may not have a full  analysis plan yet, but provide as much detail as you can at this point  


References /5  
• Minimum of 20 scholarly research paper citations, cited properly in the body of  the text as well as a full citation in your references section. These may be used to  justify and set the background for your study (intro), or to justify your methods  choices (methods).  
• References used appropriately (i.e., appropriate to the point being made)  
• Consistent formatting  
Format /4  
• Contains all required sections in the correct order  
• Consistent fonts and other formatting throughout
