What is the Film About?  
1. What was the 1985 Council of the European Economic Community’s Seal Pups  
Directive?
banned products made from white-coat seal pups, targeting one type they don't even sell; caused whole market to crash by tarnishing reputation; the Inuit's great depression


**It was a directive that outlined measures on how EU countries could ensure that skins and derived products from pups of harp seals and hooded seals (blue-backs) would not be commercially imported (from commercial hunts) into their territory. I’m not sure that this would really count as a “ban” but in many ways acted as such for those species at the very least.**

- crashed market because: public response was to not purchase any seal products


1. What was the 2010 EU ban on seal products? How was it different from the 1985  
directive?  
- white-coat seal pups already banned
- sea products not allowed into EU - total ban
- say there is an exception for inuit personal use; however they also do COMMERCIAL use 

**This was an expansion of the directive into a complete ban on seal products that now included a variety of other seal species and adult seals eliminating all commercial sale of seal products in the 27 EU nations. They did create an exemption for seal products that were derived from Inuit and Indigenous harvest, but this still impacted the market for these products to such an extent that Inuit still lost their potential income from these products which supported their communities and ability to continue their way of life.**

1. What have been the implications of these bans for the Inuit community that we  
meet in Angry Inuk?  
- caused a depression
- could not sell productss because public perception of seal products was negatively impacted (1985) and then banned(2010)
- they want to be able to do it commercially, not necessarily just "traditionally", because they need to be able to participate in the cash economy
	- need to be able to purchase fuels and equipment for hunting, and food, forced into the cash economy
	- also they were forced away from traditional areas by the Canadian government - forced away from their traditional way of life

1. How have environmental non-governmental organizations (ENGOs) played a role in  
this issue?  
- they create media attention. try to ban it; make it sound like it is all happpening in gulf near Mexico

1. How have governments played a role in this issue?  
 implemented bans - in EU

2. How have the affected Inuit communities played a role in this issue?

- powerful actors and less powerful actors with different value stakes and abilities to act
- abilities to bring in funding is easier for those disconnected from the traditional use

3. What are the opportunities and barriers for resolution?  

4. What did you learn from this film that you can apply to thinking about multi- stakeholder management of biodiversity in your case study ecosystem?
