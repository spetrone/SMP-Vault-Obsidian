# Part 1: To the Brink  
1) **What was the conservation issue in this segment of the podcast that**  
**prompted action?**  

Goats
- originally brought by whalers and pirates - was a major port on the whaling route for fresh water and land tortoises - boats would take them by the hundreds
	- they would eat tortoises - would last on their backs for a year
	- goats got braver and ventured over the rocks and population exploded to over 100,000 goats eating everything in their path
- destroyed the forest!!

2) **What was the underlying conservation ethic, or aim of the conservation**  
**biologists in regard to the system?**  

- tortoises need forest
- tortoises needed help - would we let them go extinct for the goats - there are already many islands with goats bout these toroises are only here
- goats needed to go - had been there for over 500 years - people said they had the right to be there

3) **What action was taken?**  
- 1994 - tortoise summit in England
- Project Isabella - helicopters and two shooters
	- follow goat, find its friends, get them in group, then shoot them
	- in under a year - wiped out 90% of goats
		- gets more difficult when more rare - they get more educated about hiding
	- new technique : judice goats - herd animals
		- fire up helicopter, find goats, capture them live, put radio collar on them and put them back on the island, and goat will find other goats
		- start tracking judice goat, shoot everyone except judice goat, and repeat; every two weeks for a year
			- judice goat would never get pregnant but would search and be searched
					- sterilize them in the field, and gave females hormone implants putting them in heat for long durations - more than 180 days
		- 2 year program - hundreds of judice goats
			- then when only judice goats meeting - they are done - mid 2006
		- was done island by isand (not just Isabella) - elimiated over 250,000 goats over 7 years
	- protests led locals (fishermen) to return goats in protest, and to kill tortoises, so they left the judice goats

4) **How well did the conservation action work toward solving the goal of the**  
**conservation biologists and why?**  
- yes absolutely effective - plants and trees grew back and tortoises got their home back

4) What do you think about the ethical dilemma posed in this case study: is it ok to  kill animals of one species to save another?  
 - it is fine


4) Do you agree with the management action to taken to control invasive goats on - yes except for the hormonal intervention in judice goats 

Isabella Island? Why or why not? What would you have changed?  




# Part 2: Resurrection  

7) **What was the conservation issue in this segment of the podcast that**  
**prompted action?**

Pinta - insects, birds
- however, spinning out of control
- vegetation growing wild, forest overgrown with wrong kind of plants
- whole ecosystem out of balance - an island with ***no tortoises***
	- they disperse seeds, mow down vegetation
	- went extinct in 1906; except in 1972 in Santa Cruz island - one male tortoise found - George

8) **What was the underlying conservation ethic, or aim of the conservation**  
**biologists in regard to the system?**  
- restart tortoise populations
- wanted to get George to mate to save the Pinta island on tortoise - he didn't like other tortoises much - he was not curious
- in July 1978 - George mated with the other tortoises (two females) - and they laid eggs; but they were infertile
- one opinion - shoot the tortoise and don't be prescious - and put other tortoise species on Pinta
	- what is the right way to protect nature now? 
	- what is the right strategy?
- how do we decide which species to save, and on what basis can we make these decisions?
- lonesome George dies and the tortoise went extinct


8) **What action was taken?**  
- tried to get George to mate, didn't work, he died
- then operation Pheonic
	- selectively choosing most Pinta DNA 
		- in 4 generations could have 90% Pinta genome
		- 4 generations takes 100 years
		- or could get most Pinta-ish tortoises
	- then sterilized 39 tortoises and put them on Pinta to control vegetation on Pinta until originals are ready

10) **How well did the conservation action work toward solving the goal of the**  
**conservation biologists and why?**  
- did not conserve the species
- worked to preserve ecology and come up with a possible way to semi-resurrect tortoises

11) Do you agree with the management action to taken to try to save the Pinta Island  
tortoise from extinction? Why or why not?  

12) Do you think ecosystem function is more important to conserve than individual  
species, in cases like this?  
Across both case studies:  


13. Like for the invasive goats case study in the Galapagos, invasive species  
management on islands is almost always extremely costly and the management  
efforts are never “finished”.  
a) How important do you think invasive species management is in terms  
of global conservation priorities?  
b) How should we choose which invasive species to target, or which  
endemic species to try to save?  
c) Who should make these decisions?  


14. Thinking back to last week’s discussion on the influence of human systems of  
power and inequality on conservation decisions requiring multi-stakeholder  
cooperation, what is your impression from this podcast of how well conservation is  
done in the Galapagos Islands, from a human perspective?  
a) Who seem to be the major actors?  
b) Who seem to be the funders?  
c) How are local people involved?
