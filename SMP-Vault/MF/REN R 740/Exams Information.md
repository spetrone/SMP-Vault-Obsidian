EXAMS:
- what inputs are required
- Explore pages for level of depth
- describe how they are structured
- e.g. FFMC vs. DC and what each indicates
	- e.g. people/fleeting ignitions from FFMC - cigarettes, mufflers, vs. lightning with DC/DMC

EQUATIONS WILL BE PROVIDED on midterm - but you need to know which ones to use and pick out and how to use them
- may give us FFMC --> and calculate moisture content from that - so understand the index value and its relationship with moisture content

Deeper equations in spreadsheet will not be on the exam
