**Fire danger** - assessment of both the static and dynamic factors of the fire environment which determine:
- ease of ignition
- rate of spread
- difficulty to control
- fire risk

**Fire hazard** - potential fire behavior of a fuel complex, without consideration of the state of the fuel moisture

## CFFDRS - Canadian Forest Fire Danger Rating System
composed of:
- Fire Weather Index System (FWI)
- Fire Behavior Prediction System (FBP)
- Accessory Fuel Moisture System (AFMS)
- Fire Occurrence Prediction System (FOP)

FWI and FBP are used every day

**FWI** - provides a means of evaluating the severity of fire weather conditions in a common standardized forest type

FBP - relies on outputs from the FWI system and other information - e.g. topography and time of year
- quantitative assessments of fire behavior in a number of major fuel types across Canada. 

AFMS - moistur emodels to provide more temporal resolution to some fast response time fuels + means to convert moisture code to stand-sepcific moisture

FOP - not a single developed system - evaluated each day by local fire managers using fuel moisture, lightning or potential human activity + professional experience
- some models created for lightning prediction - no standardized national system


US National Fire Danger Rating System (NFDRS) uses physical modelling and experimental burning in labs - inputs and outputs (indices) are similar, modeling philosophies different to CFFDRS
	- NFDRS allows for actual fuel moisture estimates or moisture sticks (surrogates)


- outputs from fire danger rating systems must be interpreted regionally for a given forest type, climate and topography
