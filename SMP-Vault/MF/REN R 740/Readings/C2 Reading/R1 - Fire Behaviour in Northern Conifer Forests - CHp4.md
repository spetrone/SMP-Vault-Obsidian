 
- two limiting criteria : rate of forward heat transfer and fuel quantity

- Five classes of fire:
	1. Smoldering fire (< 10 kW/m)


### Fire Behaviour Principles:
1. There must be sufficient fuel of an appropriate size and arrangement
2. This fuel must be of sufficient dryness to support a spreading combustion reaction
3. There must be an agent of ignition


***A primary requirement is a continuous layer of finely divided fuel or minor vegetation on the surface of the ground.***
- present AND continuous for fire SPREADING

### Limiting Criteria on fire Spread
*in any mix of the complex dynamics of fire/combustion*
1. The fire must transfer enough heat forward to dry out the unburned fuel and raise it to the ignition temperature by the time the flame front arrives.
2. Enough fuel must pass through the moving flame front to produce a continuous solid flame.


### Fire Description
- one quantity:
- rate of spreadcalculation:
	- I = HWR
	
I = energy output per unit length of front (kW/m)
H = low heat combustion of the fuel (kJ/kg)
W = weight of fuel consumed per unit area (kg/m^2)
R = rate of spread (m/s)


### Northern Fuels
four kinds
	1.  Litter Layer/dead foliage:
		1. dead foliage litter
		2. moss or lichen that may become dry even when live
		3. fine shrubs with a component of fine dead twigs
	2. Deep organic layers composed of partially decomposed vegetative remains; sometime 15+cm - mostly burned by smouldering fire, not related as much to spread.
		1. dependent on moisture
	3. Fallen dead tries
		1. needs high quantities to cause a flare up and crowing
	4.  live foliage - significant bearing on crown fire behaviour:
		1. total weight per unit ground area
		2. bulk density within the crown space
		3. moisture content
		4. flammable wax, oil and resin content


### Weather and Climate = FIRE CLIMATE
- Seasonal - spring needles have less moisture due to more starch
	- latitude affects temperatures, sun angle - in northern latitudes most fire conditions develop in June, July
- ##### Weather Requirements (for fire):
 1. Rainless periods of at least one or two weeks
2. Occasional days of low relative humidity, high temperature, and high wind
3.  Lightning storms of limited extent

### Kinds of Fire
1. **Smouldering fires** in deep organic layers (< 10 kW/m)
2. **Surface backfires** (burning against the wind) (100-800 kW/m)
3. **Surface headfires** (burning with the wind) ( 200 - 150000 kW/m)
	- sensitive to wind speed
4. **Crown fires** (advancing as a single front) (8000-40,000 kW/m)
	- *passive* - trees torch as individuals, reinforcing spread rate but otherwise similar to surface fires
	- *active* - solid flame develops in the crowns - surface and crown phases advance as a linked unit dependent on each other
		- most common
		- start from surface, often fall back to surface if wind drops
			- crowned-out patterns reflecting wind variation - mosaic 
	- *independent* - advances in the crowns alone
	- Determining factor of type:
		- heigh of crown above ground
		- bulk density of foliage in crown
		- crown foliar moisture content
		- initial surface intensity
		- rate of spread after crowning
1. **High-intensity spotting fires** (up to 150,000 kW/m)
	- high winds throw flaming brands ahead of main front - coalescence of spot fires at certain distances and frequencies enhances rate in complex manner

## FIRE PREDICTION
- two approaches: emperical ( & corelating with burning conditions), modeling

#### Empirical approach
- requires observational studies correlated with burning conditions
- in Canada used to develop Canadian forest danger rating system - most studied is jack pine and lodgepole pine
	R = 0.04 (ISI)^1.8 m/min in mature well-stocked forest where ISI is the Canadian Initial Spread Index
	- relationship holds well throughout known range of fire behaviour in this kind of forest
	- leafless aspen in spring:
		R = 0.3 (ISI) m/min
- quantitative relationships not available for all species in Canada boreal forest
- Generalizations:
1. jack & lodgepole most flammable throughout fire season - surface and crown
2. Black spruce less prone to surface than pine; in severe conditions, crowns with equal vigor
3. Trembling aspen and white birch - highest flammability for surface fire in spring - littler dries quickly and exposed to sun
4. Summer - hardwood less flammable than conifers from litter - don't support crown fires
5. Lowland forests - usually black spruce - require a longer drought to render them flammable than do upland pine or spruce forest
#### Modeling Approach
- mathematical models derived from theory and laboratory test fires
	- e.g. Rothermel, Albini
	- doesn't take into account varying height of fuels in same complex - i.e. multiple layers of fuel - important for Northern fires that are active (surface and crown)


### Lightning Fire Ignitions
- common in arctic regions
- if accompanied by rain (likely), require:
	- must be some protected dry fuel available for ignition - e.g. punky wood stumps or locks, pockets of organic matter base of trees
	- fuel must be able to smoulder slowly for up to several days while the local surface fuel dries out enough to carry fire
	- there must be a large adjacent area on which little rain has fallen for some longer period of time
- What is caught? - mostly tall trees, dead snags; also any trees
- Prediction depends on:
	1. current estimate of the moisture state of the susceptible fuel
	2. record of the areas struck by lightning as the storms pass by

## Fire Regimes and Ecology
- three aspects important: 
1. intensity
2. depth of burn (depends on drought level)
	1. can be predicted from the Duff Moisture Code of Canadian fire dange system
3. frequency

### Relative Intensity Classes:
Class 1: Fires so gentle that trees are not scarred (surface vegetation might be killed)
-- boundary around 300 kW/m
Class 2: Fires intense enough to kill some trees within a small given area but not all (some trees may be scarred); and
-- boundary around 1500 kW/m
Class 3 (most boreal): Fires intense enough to kill all trees over a wide area.
	- crowning or girdling, or scorching entire foliage
	- Boreal species small - most cannot withstand scorch height over 1500 kW.m (class 2 - 3)


### Regime - Frequencies and Pattern
- frequency depends on climate and fuel accumulation rates following each fire
	- in some rough long-term equilibrium with longevity of main tree species and ages they reproduce after fire
	- for ecosystems adapted to stand-replacing fires - there will be some optimum regime to meet ecological requirements

## Tree Species and Fire Adaptation
-  two types of fire-adapted trees:
		1. species able to regenerate even though all individuals are killed over a wide area
			- conifers with serotinous cones
			- hardwoods that sucker from roots or sprout from the root collar
			- species that bank seeds in the soil
			- Canadian boreal species:
				black spruce, jack pine, lodgepole pine, trembling aspen, white birch
		*note that conifer species in northern Europe and Asia are not considered serotinous and therefore fires there are not considered of lethal mean intensity*
		2. species of which some individuals must remain alive to provide seed for the next generation
			- species whose seed is release every year when the cones mature.
			- Northern Canadian species requiring variable fire intensity (pockets protected by topography or pockets in class 1 or 2):
			  white spruce, balsam, alpine firs, tamarack
	- requirements for germination for Canadian boreal species is on burned and bared surface (except firs); require one or more of immediate effects of fire:
		- killing of all or some of the overhead canopy;
		- removal of all or some of the soil's organic layer
		- some degree of control over minor vegetation.

### Interactions of these factors:
1. a short fire interval on a given site may promote hardwoods over conifers in th enext generation because the ability to sprout or sucker appears at an earlier stage than abundant seed.
2. A long fire interval, during which the hardwoods die out, may promote the conifers because of their greater longevity
3. Intense fire in a young conifer stand may provide good opportunity for hardwood invasion by seed. Trembling aspen seed, in particular, can travel long distances on the wind to take advantage of mineral seedbed when there is no other competition.
4. Multi-aged stands of conifers may form in areas burned by the nonlethal intensity classes 1 and 2. The pines especially recover well from partial girdling by fire.
5. Because lowland areas become flammable only after a great length of drought than do uplands it follows that fire is generally more frequent and mean age of stands is lower in the upland forest than in the lowland.
6. Because of the great dependence of most boreal species on mineral seedbeds for successful germination, variation in depth of burn on a given area may produce great difference from generation to generation in conifer density.
7. In Mixed hardwoods/conifers, lethal fire that fails to burn deeply may promote the hardwoods over the conifers in the post-fire forest, since their vegetative regeneration mechanisms are independent of seedbed


*fire researchers at the Petawawa National Forestry Institute have repeatedly observed plentiful healthy black spruce and jack pine seedlings on bare dmineral surfaces, but few or none on thick residual organic matter. This may be the cause of the Northern limit of tree distribution*

## Vegetation and Fuel Cycles
- with periodic fires vegetation develops in cycles and the flammability of vegetation fluctuates throughout cycles
- common assumption is that old stands breaking up are more flammable than young stands - however it is more the quantity and arrangement of fine fuels than downed logs of deep organic matter.
- overmature stands are more flammable than mature stands not breaking up because there will be a proportion of downed logs perfect for fuel.
- increased at young age to young-medium age, then decreases at maturity until overmaturity when it increases again
