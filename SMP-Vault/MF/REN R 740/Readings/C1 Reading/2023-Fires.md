- dramatic amplification inconsistent with historical data
- fires exhibited typical large fire behaviour, sizes consistent with other fires and burned under consistent fire conditions with historical records
- more fires of large fires
- defining features of the season a multi-modal season:
	- cluster of 13 highly anomalous lightning-ignited large fires >10,000ha
	- another mode of fire: consistent large fires in the N of Alberta (N of 57) showing impacts of top-down climate influence on fire behaviour.
- Multi-modal fire seasons may become more prevalent and increase severity of fire seasons


### Background
- 2.2M hectares estimated 
- 36 large fires > 10,000 ha generated 95% of annual area burned
- showed sizes, fire weather and behaviour consistent with historical fires - just far more of them in 2023
- Early May temporarily concentrated outbreak in west-central Alberta coincided with extreme potential rate of fire spread
	- (1) outbreak, then after May to Sept. intermittent - two modes of fire season severity produced annual burned areas on par with historical extremes, but together amplified area burned to record-breaking amounts
	- Alberta’s May 2023 large fire outbreak was highly unusual with respect to combined seasonality and cause. No other fire season in the preceding four decades (1983–2022) produced more than four fires ≥10 000 ha before May 16th, whereas in 2023 there were 18.
	- more lightening-caused - not typical before mid-May - People are the primary cause of ignitions before mid-May, accounting for 96% of fires 1983–2023,
		- mean lightening-caused per year : 10.7, 2023 - 72 (not unprecedented though)
	- . There were also atypical frequencies of lightning-ignited fires after September 12th (_n_ = 13), with one reaching a final size ≥10 000 ha, which is unprecedented in the preceding four decades.
- 86% of forest in FPA - Forest Protection Area where province manages fires
- 1923 - 2023 82.5% of current forest area has burned
- There is no indication that fires in 2023 were unusually large. Rather, it appears that large fires simply occurred more frequently than in the preceding 40 years (J. Berverly)
- It is evident that severe fire seasons in the province are characterized by multiple fires ≥10 000 ha which typically present as intermittent phenomena, consisting of single-day or consecutive 2-day periods with a maximum of 1–3 fires ≥10 000 ha reported per day. That pattern was evident in 2023, but with more frequent intermittent large fire activity, coupled with the previously noted atypical large fire outbreak period in early May



### Possible Influential Factors
- Lightning occurrence and ignitions - prior to green-up
- Fire weather and fuel moisture conditions - anomalous weather conditions - dry, warm, windy
- climate warming, hemispheric teleconnections and phenology - correlations beween Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) and El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO)
- phenology - earlier bud break could modulate threat from lightning strikes before green-up --> however it seems to be moving later
- fuel load and landscape heterogeneity
	- Low flammability deciduous forests are expected to expand in boreal regions as a result of climate warming and wildfire, thereby generating a negative feedback or a cooling effect; however, [Massey et al. (2023)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfr-2024-0099#core-ref38) reported no evidence of this effect over the 2000–2015 period in boreal Alberta.
	- [Baltzer et al. (2021)](https://cdnsciencepub.com/doi/10.1139/cjfr-2024-0099#core-ref10) reported evidence of post-fire regeneration failure in black spruce across the western North American boreal forest with postfire trajectories towards Jack pine or aspen in the Boreal Plains ecozone where most of Alberta’s large fires occurred in 2023
	- if deciduous species move up and phenological shifts of bud burst/green-up time does not shift up - the cooling effect of non-flammable deciduous species will not modulate and may make worse
	- Resource limitations
