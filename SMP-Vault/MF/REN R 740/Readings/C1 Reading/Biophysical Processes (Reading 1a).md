## Definitions
- **heat**: the energy associated with random motion of molecules. Can be transferred.
- **temperature**: the average kinetic energy of the molecules. Remains constant.
-  **thermal conductivity** of material: quantity of heat transported in a unit time under a unit temperature gradient
- **volumetric heat capacity**: ability of material to absorb heat
- **thermal diffusivity**: ratio thermal conductivity : volumetric heat capacity
- **advection:** the usually horizontal movement of a mass of fluid (such as air or an ocean current)****



## Processes
### Heat Transfer Processes
- convection, conduction, & radiation -- all wildfire effects on trees result
#### 1. Conduction 
- at atomic and molecular level
- transfer of temperature down a temperature gradient from more energetic molecules to less energetic molecules 
- - molecule energy defined by:
	- random translational motion
	- internal motion
	- vibrational motion
- *collision* of molecules is the transfer mechanism - transfers energy from more energetic molecule to less energetic molecule
	- for pure metallic solids also: transfer of free electrons
- when: no bulk motion of molecules, therefore most common in *solids*, but also fluids in some conditions
- *Rate* characterized by Fourier's Law - temperature gradient, cross-sectional area and thermal conductivity t
	- TC affected by water content, density, temperature

#### 2. Convection
- heat transfer down temperature gradient between a solid body and a fluid 
	- e.g. tree bole or fuel element to air or water
- transfer mechanisms: *diffusion* at the molecular level (like conduction) & *bulk motion*
- Characterized by Newton's Law of cooling: based temperature gradient between fluid and solid surface, convective SA, phenomenological heat transfer coefficient (dependent on interactions of fluid and body)
	- convection from surface to the fluid
	- advection from boundary layer into the bulk fluid
- determined by *boundary layer* at fluid-body interface - defined by gradient in fluid velocity and temperature
-  **free convection** (natural): temperature gradient between a body and a stationary bulk fluid - creates density gradient in fluid 
	- density gradient acted on by gravity, inducing bulk motion
	- thermal boundary layer created by heat diffusion between body and fluid - inducing advective flows
- **forced convection**: bulk flow driven by external forcing condition such as wind.
	- boundary layer development determined by fluid properties (velocity, viscosity, thermal conductivity)
	- flow velocities higher --> convection higher with forced convection
- forced and free convection occur together in reality

#### 4. Radiation
- **Thermal radiation:** the emission of energy in the form of electromagnetic waves or photons 
- No temperature gradient
- does not require matter - can occur in vacuum
- wavelengths between 0.1 and 100 micrometres
- occurs from all matter above absolute zero - solid bodies and fluids
- electromagnetic waves caused by changes in electron configurations by vibration and rotation of atoms and molecules.
	- Stefan Boltzmann law, which states that the flux of energy emitted by a body (the emissive power) is proportional to the emissivity of the body and the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the bodyâ€™s surface
	- incident radiation can be reflected or absorbed - amount absorbed = *absorptivity*
	- will continue to emit and absorb until at thermodynamic equilibrium with surroundings
- Transfer mechanism:
	- requires that they can "see" each other/not blocked
		- dependent on geometry, orientation, temperatures, and radiative properties
	- *view factor*: proportion of energy emitted by one body that is intercepted by another; function of geometry and distance between objected.

### Combustion
- fire = combustion processes were fuel supply rates are controlled by positive feedback of heat from the combustion process itself

- **Combustion definition:** an exothermic oxidation reaction that converts volatile (gaseous phase) hydrocarbon fuels and oxygen into various products including carbon dioxide, water, carbon monoxide, and unburned carbon (soot and tar)
- Types of combustion:

	- **flaming combustion:** with a diffusion flame - volatile fuel and oxygen must mix. Fuel diffuses outward from center of flame to exterior and combustion occurs in the zone where gaseous fuel and oxygen mix.
		- limited by the mixing of these gases.

	- **smoldering combustion**: lacks a flame; oxidation occurs on the surface of pyrolyzed solid fuel elements.
		- For smoldering combustion to occur, heat produced by oxidation reactions must be greater than heat lost to evaporation of water, fuel preheating and pyrolysis, and heat transfer into the soil or air.
	- difference = rate of pyrolysis - rate of gaseous fuel

- **adiabatic flame temperatures** - those attained theoretically with complete combustion and no heat loss from the system. - 1325 +-100 C for flame -realistically because not complete (tar, soot, etc. - ~1000 C),
	- 600-750 C for smoldering combustion, because incomplete

- **Pyrolysis:** an endothermic reaction that breaks down organic polymers such as cellulose and hemicellulose for oxidation to occur. This is a prerequisite but not part of combustion.


### Basic Forest fire process:
1. fuel elements pre-heated so solid fuel dries and pyrolizes.
2. when enough volatiles produced from pyrolization, combustion can begin.

### Heat Transfer to Soil
- **Duff layer:** decomposing organic matter below litter layer, above mineral layer (F and H layers)
	- decrease heat tranasfer - less conductive, insulates (esp. with more water)
	- increase heat transfer - facilitates smoldering combustion = longer heating duration
- complex, involving convection, conduction, and radiation
- thermal properties vary depending on mineral composition, structure and volume fractions of organic matter, mineral matter, and water (water movement very important)
- models say that heat penetration: decreases with water content, increases with thermal conductivity, heating duration, and amount of heat transferred to the surface.
- **surface heating:** result of energy balance between fire and surface - depends on type of combustion
	- smoldering - combustion, convection, and radiation
	- flaming: convection and radiation


### Fire Plumes:
- Free convection process from combustion within the fire front
- turbulent upward bulk flow of gases driven by buoyancy forces from density differences between heated and ambient air
- Can be tilted/distorted by wind
	- wind can cause more turbulence and increase mixing causing increased combustion
- Three regions:
1. persistent flame - heat continually produces by flaming combustion (oxidation) reactions
2. intermittent flame - flaming combustion is irregular
3. buoyant plume - no flaming combustion reactions

### Fire Classification:
- based on type of combustion and fuels involved + (surface, crown) frontal intensity.
##### 1. Ground Fires
Smoldering combustion of duff and litter generally occurring after the flaming fire front has passed. Can persist for hours or days after.
##### 2. Surface Fires
Typified by intensities of less than 2500 kWm-1
- varies with canopy heigh, canopy moisture content, weather, etc.
##### 3. Crown Fires 
- Typified by flaming combustion of fine fuels in tree crowns such as branches, buds and foliage. 
- Generally have intensitiesg creater than 2500 kWm-1
- further classification:
	- passive crown fire - requires heat flux from surface fuels
	- active crown fires - burn independently of surface fuels


Heat-induced necrosis
- focus on apical and lateral meristems as they generate tissues
- Cause:
	- denaturation of proteins - starts at 60C; rate increases exponentially with temp.
		- can occur at lower temps with long exposure
- Transfer:
	- Bole: radiation and convection to surface, then conduction from surface through bark into interior of bole
		- time for cambium necrosis scales as second power of bark thickness - depends on thermal properties of bark -  temp gradient in bark, heat duration, thermal conductivity, specific heat, and thickness of bark
		- **Girdling by fire:** cambium necrosis (and thus phloem necrosis) - eventual tree mortality as photosynthates cannot be transported to roots - fine roots no longer develop
			- partial --> fire scare, usually on downwind (leeward) side of boles - from pair of vortices on leeward side of tree creating a standing leeward flame - more with large diameter and strong wind velocity; small trees don't create it and usually get completely girdled
	- **Crown** (branches, buds, foliage)
		- transferred to crown from fireline and plume by radiation and convection (convection dominant)
			- necrosis height a function of fireline intensity^2/3 modified by a proportionality factor *k*
		- different necrosis heights for buds and foliage (foliage create shielding effect reducing convection rates- pronounced in needle-leaf species due to less porous foliage structure)
		- models depends on *k*, for heat transfer process linking plume and crown component temperatures varying by species and season -theoretically Van Wagner (1973) says necrosis height depends on temp gradient b/w plume and crown, residence time, + 4 thermophysical properties of crown component - heat transfer coeff., SA, mass, specific heat capacity.
- Roots
	1. Heat transfer from the fire to the soil surface
	2. Heat transfer through the soil
	3. Heat transfer from the soil and into the root
		1. root surface will increase creating temp. gradient in root which initiated conduction 
		- vascular cambium necrosis results from conduction through the bark
		- root apical meristem necrosis occurs from conduction into the root tip
		- 
	- no root necrosis depth models that include conduction in root yet, only soil
	- unique to roots is that soils may remain warm or have smoldering combustion that maintains temperatures lower that 60C for longer periods which may still cause necrosis
- Integrating Crown, Bole and Root necrosis and defining tree mortality
	- currently based on proportion of vegetative buds killed in the crown unless killed by all buds nectrotic or bole girdling
		- using biophysical model with allometrically based sapwood area budget to scale variables controlling necrosis in three areas - based on meristem necroses in bole and crown; not including indirect (e.g. pathogens)
			- 1D vascular cambium conduction model + vegetative bud necrosis height with heat transfer model
			- link cambium and bud necrosis with scaling of bole bark thickness and vertical bud distribution - with tree allometry models
		- larger trees can survive fire from:
			- thicker bark insulating cambium
			- vegetative buds higher than lethal plume temperatures
	- lacking: smoldering duff composition models needed + heat transfer models for roots + allometric models for predicting vertical root distributions vs. above-ground tree size
