**fire regime**: The fire-regime concept is composed of fire-related characteristics that describe the occurrence and impact of fires over space and time
	- In Canada, the fire regime is commonly characterized by frequency, annual area burned, size, intensity, severity, seasonality, type (surface, crown, or ground), and cause

- trends in areas burned and number of large fires (>200 ha) have increased significantly since 1959
- more lightning-caused fire (may be part of trend ^)
- decline in human-caused fires
- Large fires have been getting larger over the last 57 years
- Fire season has been starting approximately one week earlier and ending one week later
- Regional scales: fewer significant trends, high variability
- Western Canada scale: area burned, number of large fires and lightning-caused fires are increasing; human-caused fires stable or declining throughout country
- High-level scale and trends show a trajectory towards more active fire regimes over the last half century



#### Lightning-caused fires
- increasing
- cause of most of the large 36 fires in 2023
- Whereas humans ignite the majority of fires, lightning-caused fires are responsible for more area burned because numerous lightning ignitions can occur in clusters, which can overwhelm suppression efforts, or often occur in isolated areas that are not actioned 
### Fire Activity Dynamics:
The spatial and temporal dynamics of forest fire activity are influenced by multiple factors that can be categorized into four classes:
1. weather and climate
2. fuels (i.e., flammable vegetation)
3. ignitions
4. human activities (e.g., fire management, land use).

Conclusion:
- increasing trend in area burned
	- large fires (> 200 ha make up most of area burned)
- increase in fire sizes
- Number of fires increasing
- increase in fire season length with variations in start by latitude and longitude
- More lightning-caused fires in the West + more area burned
	- stable or decreasing lightning-caused and AB in the Central and East
- More human-caused fires in shoulder seasons
	- dangerous because of curing and lack of foliage
