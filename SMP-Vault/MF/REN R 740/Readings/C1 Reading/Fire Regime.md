## Definition of Fire Regime

**Fire Regime** : Fire regime is the spatial and temporal pattern of fires and their effects in a given area and over a given time period. However, there is no clearly established definition for this concept.


Fire regime can be defined as ***the pattern of fire occurrence (average and variability) within a defined area over a certain time period.***
- characterizes:
	- which fire occurs (type, magnitude, extent)
	- how many (frequency)
	- when (seasonality)
	- where (spatial distribution) within a given spatiotemporal window
- extension of definition: includes biological (impacts), causes, and roles (social) and social perception

*scale dependent definition*
- frequency depends on spatial scale, must be associated with scale to be comparable
- Scaling laws not necessarily conducive to linear extrapolation

##### Parameters:
- **Frequency:** # fires/time period
- **Return interval:** time interval between fires in a time period
- **Seasonality:** monthly distribution of number of fire occurrences in an area in a time period
- **Size:** size of fire patch within a given area during a certain period time
- **Burned area** Area affected by fire per unit time within a given area and certain time period
- **Size Distribution**: Probability distribution of individual fire sizes in a given area and during a certain time period
- **Cycle** Time required for an area equivalent to the size of an area of interest to burn
- **Intensity**: Energy released from a fire
- **Severity**: Impacts of fire on ecosystem
- **Type**: Classification of fires according to fuel consumption and fire spread patterns
#### Contexts of fire
**Ecological context of fire** includes primary productivity, fuel structure, seasonality, and ignitions
- precipitation --> (ecosystem productivity) --> biomass (fuel)
- dry weather - availability of fuel (seasonality)
- physical arrangement of fuel (fuel structure)
- ignition source

**Physical Context of Fire:** fuel–heat–oxygen association (the “fire triangle”)

Fire occurence varation:
1. space -> e.g. boreal vs. savannah, smaller scale (geology, soils, vegetation density)
2. time - different periods - different climates, climatic anomolies - different occurrence patterns


### Drivers of Fire Regime
- Scales: flame, single fire, fire regime
- All scales  affected by humans
- There are **feedback loops*** within and across scales
- **Regime scale:**(Meyn et al. 2007). Each ecosystem has a fire regime that responds to a particular combination of (ecological context of fire):
	- biomass (fuel structure)
	- weather conditions (fuel moisture)
	- ignitions
- **Flame scale** driven by physical context
- top-down vs bottom-up: climate (top-down), fuel (bottom-up)
	- however productivity related to climate --> leads to "varying constrains hypothesis) - conceptual model allowing fire activity to vary nonlinearly along global productivity/aridity gradient
	- productive + dry seasonality difficult to determine/more complex
	- Ultimately climate = **long term superordinate mechanism determining what drivers limit fire regimes***
- fire regimes may be controlled by certain drivers (e.g. climate)


### Fire Regime Quantification:
From information about fires that occurred in the past
1. official statistics
2. remotely sensed data (satellite imagery and remote sensing)
3. growth rings in woody species (dendrochronology)
	- scars -stem injuries from nonlethal fires
	- when stands wiped out - new mosaic of even-age stands - past fires  dated by population age structure - estimate frequencies, intervals, fire cycles,
1. charcoal deposits in sediment
2. literature and accounts
