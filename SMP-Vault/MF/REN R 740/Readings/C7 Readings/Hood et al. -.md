Assignment 3 points:
- error in estimates
- generalization to all tree species from just a few (four)
	- white pine were one of the four (Van Wagner 1973)
	- not modelled with this mix though (Balsam firs/unnatural white pine forest)
- Model accuracies have not been evaluated across size ranges or for the majority of tree species, e
- . However, bark thickness-tree size relationships generally have not been validated for many species and across diameter ranges. 
	- Additionally, the thickness of the outer versus inner bark is likely more important for protection from wildfire and the ratio of these bark components varies by species (Pausas 2015, Rosell 2016). These unaccounted differences can under- or over-predict bark thickness, which can distort tree mortality estimates
- exceptions to coniferous tree responses to fire include bud survival when foliage is scorched and sprouting from epicormic buds and belowground bud banks (Meier et al 2012, Burrows 2013, Pausas et al 2018)
	- resprouting following top-kill (i.e. mortality of the aboveground ramet but not the genetic individual) confuses the very concept of fire-caused mortality 
- Empirical models are inherently limited to the underlying data distributions, creating uncertainty in accuracy when extrapolating beyond initial data ranges and for novel conditions.
	- e data used to develop current empirical models have limited scope in terms of species, sizes, and life history strategies. 
	- **in this case it is relatively close but the distribution could still be different
- data were collected primarily from fires occurring in the 1980s to the early 2000s, and therefore performance has not been evaluated under the hotter climate anticipated in many areas. 
	- ncreased temperatures exacerbate plant moisture stress via increased vapor pressure deficits
- overwhelming focus of tree mortality research has been on moderate-sized trees, with very few studies including small trees (i.e. 10 cm DBH), but fuels treatments and prescribed burning objectives often involve killing small trees.
- To accurately predict mortality of small or very large trees, different or additional predictor variables may need to be incorporated into models
	- old conifers often experience elevated mortality after fire, through a combination of factors: damage to roots from smoldering combustion in fuel accumulations near the tree base, fire burning in existing fire scars, low leaf area relative to carbon demands, and decreased hydraulic conductance (Kolb et al 2007, Hood 2010)
- most limiting aspect of current empirical models is that predictions are binary–either the tree survives or dies from fire.
	- dditional research could allow inclusion of fire injury on post-fire growth and vulnerability of surviving trees, as shown in figure 5(B).

structure of empirical models relies on simple, external measures of observable tree injuries that are proxies for the fire’s actual heat flux.

For non-resprouting species and those where crown scorch and bud kill are equal, the current framework seems to work reasonably well if the bark thickness coefficient (i.e. predicted relationship of bark thickness based on species and diameter) is correct and delayed mortality due to insects is not a factor. When the above conditions are not met, model performance is reduced due to over-simplification of species responses, extrapolation beyond the models’ underlying data, the inability to quantify long-term effects on tree-to-ecosystem productivity (see below), and difficulty correctly incorporating indirect effects on mortality.


Many fire behavior and effects software use fireinduced mortality algorithms developed from a limited number of conifers and use a simplified crowninjury response to predict mortality for numerous additional deciduous and conifer species.

sub-model estimating crown scorch height from flame length based on one study of four species (Van Wagner 1973). Further error is introduced if crown length scorched must be converted to crown volume scorched to meet model requirements


he most commonly used empirical models predict mortality of several western conifers with reasonable certainty, but perform poorly for others, 


Empirical mortality models predicting top-kill of the main stem account for stem resistance to fire by using either a species-specific model or a multi-species model with species-specific bark-thickness scaling functions based on tree diameter. T
