- fire history for characterizing regime - must be a larger area than the size of the fires

- **atmospheric stability** - how and where will smoke go - determined by atmospheric conditions and affects the fire environment

### Fuel
- fuel properties that are enduring or relatively stable over near term in absence of disturbance include inherent properties that vary naturally by species - shape, size, load, chemistry + spatial relationship
- amount of live vs dead fuel
- size and shape -+surface area
	- 
- compaction - spacing between particles
- position/arrangement
	- subsurface/ground
	- surface
	- ladder - e.g. black spruce, smaller trees and shrubs
	- aerial/crown fuels - e.g. lodgepole pine


C2 Explore video - high severity, stand-replacing fire
- front of fire
	- dense fuel
	- intense fire
		- even in  low wind - venting straight up
- back of fire - surface fire
	- fuels - variety of fuels/patchier - horizontal continuity is broken up - may be wetland/swampy
	- smoke bent over at back - being pulled by convection
- flank (side) of fire
	- leafed-out aspen; some seismic lines; variation in landcover/fuel types
	- a lot of linear features - not affecting fire
	- black smoke - incomplete combustion because of severe burning - severe, but incomplete combustion - particulate pulled up


Virtual tour
1. Young Forest
	1. sparsely arranged
	2. small young trees, grasses, shrubs
		- looks pretty wet
		- smaller spruces
1. Growing Forest (15-85 years of age)
	- more dense (compactness)
	- more larger fuels -  trees
	- wind cannot get in as easily
	- less solar radiation to ground
1. Mature forest
	-  architecture - horizontal  vertical
		- mixed heights
	- type - black spruce with some leafly shrubs at mid heights
	- compactness - dense 
	- cooler
	- darker
