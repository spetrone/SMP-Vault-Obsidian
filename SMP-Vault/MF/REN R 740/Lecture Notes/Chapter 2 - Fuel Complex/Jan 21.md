- Fire environment
- - fuels are the only thing we can manage
	- for example Jasper has been doing it for over 20 years
	- may or may not be appropriate to apply fuel thinning across all ecosystems - does not generalize across fire regimes and ecosystems
	- e.g. [in South Coast Forest ](https://www.piquenewsmagazine.com/local-news/whistler-ecologist-rhonda-millikin-cease-desist-10077126 )
		- the fuel thinning drys out the forest, and could actually make it worse
	- in AB - forestry and fire mitigation are re-organized as the same branch; like in 1914

- Landscape features like narrow and wide  
canyons, ridges, chutes and saddles can  
dramatically affect fire behavior  

- Narrow steep canyons act as chimneys –  
create strong updrafts of air  
	▪ Increase convective and radiative heat  
transfer, preheating upslope fuels  
	▪ Can radiate to opposite side  
C2-Fire Environment Fundamentals

▪ Chute is a steep V-shaped drainage  

▪ Saddle refers to the depression between two  
adjacent hilltops  

▪ Chutes and saddles change prevailing wind  
patterns by funneling air, increasing wind speed -  
intensifying fire behavior

### Barriers
*depends on fire behavior - e.g. low intensity grass fire vs crown fire*
- *sometimes it will jump barriers e.g. with convection outdraft sending embers across barriers
- 
- *
- Natural barriers:
	- rivers, lakes
	-  rock outcropping or slides, burned areas, swamps
- Constructed barriers;
	- roads
	- highways reservoirs
	- fireline constructed by fire suppression resources

## Weather vs climate
- **Weather is the state of the atmosphere**  
**over the surface of the earth**  
- It’s a result of the interaction of  
temperature, wind, relative humidity  
(RH), and precipitation.  
- Weather is by far the most changeable  
factor affecting wildland fire behavior
***- wind is key*** - can change dramatically


### Relative Humidity:

- RH is the percentage of moisture in a volume of air  
relative to the total amount of moisture that the  
volume of air can hold at the given temperature and  
atmospheric pressure (higher temp, higher potential )
- if temps increase, with same amount of water vapour, then the RH will go down 
 -  When air holds the maximum amount of moisture, the  
air is saturated, and its RH is 100% 
- high RH, adds water to fuels, dampening them - less likely to burn
- when RH is < 30%, air absorbs moisture from fuels, dehydrates them, and makes them more susceptible to ignition
- e.g. **crossover** - temp increases more than RH, red flag for forestry


### Temperature
- there is diurnal variation 
	- coolest near daybreak, warmest during late afternoon
	- 4-5 PM is the most intense fire conditions
- seasonal variation
	- coolest in winter
	- warmest in summer
- variation with elevation, aspect, forest cover
- hotness or coldness of the atmosphere - determined by radiation from the sun


### WIND
- drys out fuels
- bends flame
- adds oxygen
- strong, dry winds - draws out moisture from fuel
- shorter residence time of fire - does not burn as deeply - just races across an area and then is out - consuming flashy fuel only

### Fronts
- #RENR740exam
- MAKE SURE TO UNDERSTAND FOR EXAM
- unstable airmass - accelerates convection and burning
- remain strong and gusty, then temps rapidly cool down and RH goes up
- the winds associated with high and low pressure systems
- local winds ahead of the front will shift - move counter-clockwise around the low
- as Low (cold front) moves across, the winds change suddenly with strong winds == vulnerable conditions
	- this happeed with Fort McMurray


### Thunderstorm Winds
- indrafts and downdrafts can result in sudden changes in rate and direction of fire spread as well as intensity
- indraft range from 16 - 32 km/h and gusty
- downdraft speeds range from 40-56m/h with gusts over 100km/h
- leading edge of a downdraft is a boundary between two dissimilarair masses, similar to a cold front
- typically marked by wind shift, decrease in temperature and increase in RH

### Precipitation
- Precipitation is liquid or solid water particles  
originating in the atmosphere and falling to the  
earth’s surface  
▪ Fuel moisture is affected by the amount and  
duration of the precipitation  
▪ Fine fuels react rapidly to precipitation – they  
gain/lose moisture within an hour


4 weather elements:
- temperature
- wind
- precipitation
- RH
- also atmospheric stability - e.g. lifting processes, jetstream

### Fuel Moisture
definition:  Fuel moisture content is the amount of water in a fuel, expressed a percent of  
the oven-dry weight of the fuel
- determines ignition likelihood and speed of combustion
- lower burning process
	- fuel will not burn until moisture heated and converted to vapor - will give off vapor as temp approaches 100C
	- evaporating moisture consumes energy and the water vapor released dilutes combustible gases
- higher fuel moisture - slower burning process
- 
![[Pasted image 20250121102732.png]]
- live vs dead fuel moisture - very different moisture content
	- **live fuels**
	-  foliar moisture content  (FMC)(moisture content of needles) - major drop in spring
		- young conifer needles - 200-250, 85-120 for old needs, ~200% for deciduous foliage
		- varies during over a season but unaffected by weather
		- young actively growing green vegetation absorbs weather
		- age and species affect the amount o moisture they can hold
		- **spring dip*** - moisture content of live green needles in the canopy
			- follows a seasonal pattern of foliar moisture content - caused by the timing of new growth in the spring
			-  only the old sprouts - dips just before flush of new growth - dips down to 85-100% - very low == deadly time for fires
	- **dead fuel**
		- When plants die, most of the water in the  
		plant tissues evaporates.  
			▪-Dead fuel moisture is the moisture  
		remaining in dead biomass, including  
		annual grasses, woody debris, litter (fallen  
		needles, leaves), decaying organic matter,  
		slash  
		▪ Moisture contents 2-400%  
		▪ ***Strongly influenced by changes in weather***  
		***and topography and can change quickly***  
		***over time and space.***

## Equilibrium Moisture content 
 - Fuels moisture is dynamic and will move  
towards equilibrium  with atmosphere/environment
- Equilibrium is achieved at different rates  
- The rate is quantified by the time lag,  
which describes the responsiveness of the  
fuels  
(modified from: Flannigan 2017)  
C2-Fire Environment Fundamentals

- lower temp higher RH - lower equilibrium - not sucking moisture out
- higher temp - lower RH - higher equilibrium - sucking moisture out
- at equilibrium- maintains moisture

Time lag
- time it takes from initial moisture content to reach 63% of difference to equilibrium 
	- 63% because it is an exponentila function
- fine fuels - high SA to vol ration - short time lag
- large fuels - low SA to vol ratio - longer time lag
