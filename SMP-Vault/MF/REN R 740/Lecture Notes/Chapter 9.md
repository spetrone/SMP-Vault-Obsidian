**Fire Response:**
- buckets
	- fill up water bladders, AKA pumpkins
- different sized lines depending on water availability
- sprinklers used to protect homes
- hand tools used to put out small fires - spot fires


	- the narrative that we have not known about the ecological benefits of fire, and have not tried to use fire for management / allowed fire for ecological benefits, and all we do is suppress fire, and that now we know and we can just allow some fire. 
		- we have known for a long time
		- it is very difficult to actually manage fire without suppressing it; 
		- It is not that we don't know what we need to do, we don't know how to do it.
		- narrative gets black and white, but it is not, it is nuanced

know different tactics and equipment



- Canada - management is a provincial/territorial responsibility
	- federal involvement in fire management is limited to national parks
	- 10 provincial and 2 territorial agencies
- Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre - coordinates resources nationally

#### Priorities
Two dominant:
- public safety top priority 
- protection of forest resources
Others:
- ecological


- Fire management generally located within forestry departments responsible for management of natura sources or the environment, but now sometimes being moved to health and safety
	- In Alberta, was in forestry as two distinct groups, but now integrated two together.
		- big move to use forestry at the landscape level 
- most agencies have mandates under fire-specific provincial legislation
- some forest legislation also covers fire

Approved by Cabinet
### Alberta 5 Priorities 
#renr740exam
1. human life
2. communities
3. infrastructure
4. sensitive watersheds and soils
5. natural resources

*have standard operation procedures to outline procedures, decision support criteria, and operational instructions and guidelines*

- Regional risk management plans - currently under development
- link with other management planning in resource development

- prior to 1952, Alberta's fire exclusion involved fighting only fires **within 16 km of roads and major waterways**

- 1976 - targets for annual area burned  (<1%)

#### Objectives 
- reduce fire behaviour potential
- reduce fire occurrence risk
- reduce threat to value at risk
- enhance suppression capability
- enhance positive attributes of fire by emulating landscape patterns historically created by natural disturbance

### SOPs Alberta
- Immediate suppression is the objective for all wildfires
- Timely and effective initial attack strategies will be used to contain wildfires within the first burning period


- 20 Forest Areas


### Detection
- Towers
	- 97
	- backbone of detection system
	- weather reporting, communication
- aerial patrols




- initiate suppression before fire exceeds **two hectares**; after two hectares, likely not contained, and will burn into the next burning period.


- see regulations in slides - don't need to reproduce them
- 
- exam-style question
	- province is taking on additional areas or responsibility and jurisdiction - with new areas added to the forest protection areas
		- previously - municipalities


Out of Control:
Being Held:
Extinguished:


Equipment
- dozers used to make firelines
- hand tools - pulaski
- chainsaws
- aircraft
	- helicopters
	- air tankers
	- CV580
	- CL-2151
	- Electra L183

Mitigation
- changing fuels
	- stand and landscape-level

Incident Command System (ICS)
- developed after catastrophic fires
- chain of command is key
- unity of command is key - each person only accountable to one
