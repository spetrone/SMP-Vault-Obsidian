Provincial forest area: 25.6M hectares

Area burned from 1918-2023: 18.7M hectares == ~85% of current forest area

- we have NOT excluded fire as much as people saw we have.

- cause of different patterns:
	- different management
	- different forest and climates
	- different causes (now actually more lightening) - most of 2023 fires in Alberta caused by 36 lightening strikes

- Types of fire data (2):
1. Tabular data computed from records (no map) - size of fire (area burned). Data goes back further (to 1918)
2. Polygon record - mapped fires. Data goes back to 1931.
	- smaller fires may not be mapped (especially older), so may be different numbers from tabular data
therefore different statistics with tabular vs polygon data

- our data is actually quite limited (especially compared to now)


- prior to Chincaga fire (1950s) did not fight or document fires not within 16km of roads or water sources or cities.

- 95% of fires burned in 2023 caused by 36 large fires (> 10,000 ha)

- 2023 peak is an outlier - will this be a continued trend?
	- according to statistics - unlikely 
-  increase in numbers from better tracking or the actual data?
	- counts are worse than area burned in terms of reliability
	- used to not count the tiny fires (started  counting in roughly 2000 where you see the shift - administrative artifact) - also depends on the definition of a wildfire changing

- mountain forests - lodgepole pine - crown fire species ecosystems - not designed to survive burn- designed to fully burn and re-open ecosystem for complete regeneration - whereas other forests like black spruce are designed to survive burn like ponderosa (surface fire regime)
	- black spruce cones are designed to be activated by fire
	- if fire comes back to quickly, the stand has not achieved maturity to provide a seed source
		- can shift the ecosystem to a new state if it is re-burned and seed source is wiped out
	- climate change could cause fires to come back more quickly 

- narratives get simplified and transferred across regimes by media which is incorrect


Black spruce, lodgepole pine: BUILT TO BURN = **crown fire**
- bark helps fire move up
- needles burn but stems and branches generally don;t (bark helps it move up to needles)
- 80 years to grow - to then be decimated
