- most fire is in Boreal zone - most is happening outside of firefighting zone
	- fires are left to burn unless they impact communities - firefighting is done to protect people and property
	- Outside of southern BC, most population is not in fire habitat
- what is going on - when large areas of the country are burning in one summer - it is weather - especially in large variations of locations and forests - different regimes and management 
	- therefore driven by TOP DOWN process

**bottom up processes:** things on the ground; e.g. barriers to fire spread - water, rivers
**top down processes**: large-scale processes that are operating across vast areas - weather and climate

**Fine Fuel Moisture Code:** rating on moisture content/levels of fine fuel -rated every day by factors that can influence them - temperature, rain, humidity, wind
	- track factors
	- higher == drier
	- shows ease for people to start fires
	- used to determine risk
	
2023 Fires:
	- usually not receptive to ignition across whole country in a single day - however in spring of 2023 there was an extended period of very dry conditions across whole country and continued throughout summer - abnormal - usually variability across Canada
	- *omega blocking ridge* - weather gets stuck - high in between two lows
		- pattern known to be conducive to escalated fire activity

- abnormal off the charts wacky was North Atlantic sea-surface temperatures 
	- ![[Pasted image 20250109100839.png]]
- **climate teleconnections** - oceans influencing weather on the land base across the continent
	- natural fluctuations in sea surface temperatures determine weather patterns over large spatial scales - and affect fire patterns

	- example pattern: Atlantic multi-decadal oscillation 

- fires are not doing things that differently individually - but there are more of them


Strategies:
-
- 2005 - new national strategy to define principle of wildland fire management in Canada
- shift from SUPRESSION -- to --> MITIGATION
	- For mitigation used definition of risk:
		-  risk = probability  x impacts
		- requires a good ability to calculate probability though
			- many probabilities hard to measure, might be many very small probabilities
			- therefore risk more driven by the impact
		- previously risk had a different meaning
	- how do you mitigate? everyone became gung ho to mitigation
	- not about let's look holistically
	- suppression became a bad word - including detection, etc.

###### Fire Response
- prior to shift to mitigation in last 20 years, science was all about handling response:
	- point location
	- minutes, hours, days
	- reception to ignition
	- spread distance
	- intensity, severity

- previously science was about fire behavior -  predicting fire ignition, growth, intensity, etc. for putting them out 
	- then after many decades of research, about 20 years ago it shifted to mitigation and forgot about behavior
		- to change structure of fuel - fuel management
			- e.g. Jasper had lots of them
		- idea: get there before fire and change a fire before fire ignites
		- where to do it to put limited resource? - research to determine this - completely different scale of problem, from individual fires to large areas, large time horizons, high complexity and strategizing


Fire is a **chemical reaction** - chemical breakdown of solid fuel
- stored chemical energy in the forest in biomass - in carbohydrates - large organic molecules - cellulose, hemicellulose
- chain reaction like *photosynthesis in reverse*
- decades of growth in storing solar energy in chemical bonds
	- instantaneously all of that stored energy is released as light and heat
- Combustion triangle: heat, oxygen, fuel; to stop, take one of the three away.
1.  endothermic reaction - pyrolysis - solid --> gas with heat
	- system absorbed energy (~200C)
	- irreversible
	- change in chemical composition and physical phase
	- hissing noise --> pyrolysis, moisture is release and structure is breaking down, turning into gas; preheating
2. Exothermic reaction - flaming and smoldering (400-1000C)
	- releases energy (heat, light)

This chain reaction must continue together.


### FIRE ENVIRONMENT
The surrounding conditions, influences and modifying forces that determine the behavior of a fire.

Triangle: fuel, weather, topography
- fuel is what can be managed
- **Fuel**
	- size and shape
	- quantity/load
	- chemistry
	- continuity
	- arrangement
	- moisture content
- **Weather**
	- wind speed, direction
	- relative humidity
	- precipitation
	- temperature
	- atmospheric stability
- **Topography**
	- slope
	- aspect
	- elevation
	- terrain
	
Fire:
- fuel
- oxygen
- ignition

put out: smother, space out (less heat intensity), water
