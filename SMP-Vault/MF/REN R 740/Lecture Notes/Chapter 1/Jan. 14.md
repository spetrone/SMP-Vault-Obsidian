- embers fall 500m ahead of firefront - but can be km ahead of the fire
	- when the fire front is bent forward, the heating is faster --> accelerates chain reaction
	- faster preheating, faster ignition, faster spreading


- ***Slope and topography*** influence on wildifire
	- south facing - dry fuel, rain shadow
	- bends fuel towards flame potentially
		- effect on preheating, ignition, spread is positive **up hill***
		- movement of debris can also accelerate spread **up hill**

- characteristics of fuel that will affect the fire:
*fine fuels fuel the moving fire front*
	- **static fuel characteristics (fuel complex):**
		- diameter, structure, architecture, chemical compositions, arrangement on land == fuel complex - this hosts the fire
	**- fuel moisture:** variable - can change day to day, hour to hour, determined by the weather
		- fine fuels are most responsive to moisture - surface area to volume ratio is much higher
		- responsive to humidity
		- temperature and wind will accelerate the drying
	- Bad combination: dry period after period of stronger (than usual) growth of vegetation --> created a lot of fine fuels and then dried them out
	- fine fuels - flashy and intense - in California fires, that is what is burning - dry shrubs; in Boreal, for example, the boles don't really burn it is  the fine fuels
		- <1 cm diameter get burned by flame as flame moves through, then longer smoldering combustion on ground can consume more fuel over time
	- if super dry - the top 1-2 cm of duff might burn with flaming fire front
	- winds - trickiest for variability and predictability is the wind
		- sometimes wind patterns for directions and forces; can be channeled by the topography.

- grass - fine --> flashiest
	- less convention - less potential for spotting
	- very rapid and flashy leading edge, but limited intensity and limited smoldering
	- only have to put out flame front
		- can be done with hand tools to make fire breaks in removing fuel - limited convention and intensity to spread very far

#### Fire descriptors:
- intensity: heat released per unit length of fire front, while it is spreading
- type (ground, surface, crown)
- severity - effect of fire, the outcome
	- low severity - surface - don't kill big mature trees
	- high severity - crown - kills big mature trees
	- Ecological outcomes:
		- tree death

First video from C1 slides:
- tree caught from intense heat transfer radiation and convection
- the bark ignited right away and then settled after easy fuels burned
	- once the fine fuels are done the fire cannot sustain itself

### Fire Regime
**Definition:** a structured way of describing characteristic fire processes operating across broad area and time periods
- Always referenced to: SPATIAL AREA + TIME PERIOD
- used to:
	- compare the role of fire between ecosystems
	- assess the degree of departure from historical conditions
	- project potential effects (management activities, changing climate, other variables)

**Fireline Intensity** : the rate of heat transfer per unit length of fireline (kW/m). Fire type reflects the fuels involved in combustion and aligns with intensity.

5 Fire  + 2 and Fire Regime (includes first five) Attributes:
1. intensity
2. type (ground, surface, crown)
3. severity (effect)
4.  extent/size
5. cause
- ------------------
6. frequency
7.  seasonality - characteristics of fires throughout seasons in an area 
	- e.g. seasonality of Santa Anna winds and Palisade fires are abnormal

**Severity:** refers to the effects of fire and is often focussed on ecological effects but can also include socio-economic effets:
	- fuel consumption (what is burned)
	- tree scorch, char or mortality
	- atmospheric emissions
	- soil erosion
	- damaged structures
	- suppression costs
