**Define**


- surface fire regime -architect of the stand (stand-level complexity)
- crown fire regime- architect of landscape mosaics (landscape-level complexity)

- first order fire effects
	- occur at the time of the fire or within seconds or minutes afterwards
	- direct results of the combustion process - primarily heat and chemical processes
	- from fire and fire environment
	- examples:

- second order fire effects
	- examples: erosion, insect infestations, weather, seed availability, landuse

- ecosystem memory

- fire prescription

**List**

- four examples of first order fire effects

- four examples of second order fire effects

- three factors that could influence post-fire tree mortality in a surface fire regime

**Describe**

- the natural cycle of crown fire and subsequent regeneration in black spruce

- how fire return intervals influence black spruce regeneration failure

- how the landscape mosaic of patches that consist of different stand ages, stand/fuel types and different time-since-fire influences fire-vegetation dynamics in an area
	-  multiple disturbances affect dynamics
	- fire suppression alters surface regimes; structured like crown-fire ecosystem; most relevant for "fuel build-up"
		- in crown fire ecosystems - fire suppression affects landscape mosaic/ecosystem memory; reduced heterogeneity, rather than fuel build-up
		- longer return interval than is natural
	- there is a logarithmic curve for probability of escape vs. time since fire (for new fires burning in old fires)

### Other Notes (incl. Assignment C)

Surface Fires
- more structural complexity within the stand / broader age class distribution

**Fire prescription** –  set of conditions under which a fire will be ignited, in order to meet management objectives

- ***height of stem blackening is an indicator of flame length - can be plugged into Byram's fire intensity equation***

- sometimes M1 might be used with C5 stands - because natural ecosystem is altered - so it was more like a mixedwood stand - as a result of balsam fir
	- used Mixedwood 75% conifer
#### Effects of Return Intervals
- Return interval
	- short return interval - poor regen
	- long return interval - good seed recruitment
- two factors constrain black spruce recruitment - driving fire-vegetation dynamics
	- constraints on **seed germination/recruitment**  in un-burned stands - seedling recruitment and stand renewal restricted to short periods in post-fire seed beds - restriction is quality of seed beds
	- historical factors can reduce seed stores and **post-fire seed availability** - alter patterns of post-fire stand recruitment and dominance - restriction is **seed availability** from shorter intervals
- intervals are becoming shorter - altering natural state of the ecosystems and forest structure


- forest stand-level structure - surface fire regimes
	- no continuous fuels from ground to canopy
	- prevents bad fires from burning; otherwise denser ladder fuels facilitate crown fires
	- fire suppression alters architecture, must be restored
	- restoration - at stand level
		- keep areas open by burning regularly
	- characteristics of trees evolved for this structure
	- make structure resilient
- landscape-level mosaic - crown fire regimes
	- stand-replacing
	- trees not resistant to fire, 
		- trees die, evolved to die and regenerate from roots or serotinous cones
	- prescribed burns are for risk reduction
	- what could actually alter fire regime - alter the age classes - much larger scale


- restoration of ecosystems with prescribed burns applies to the surface fire ecosystems only
