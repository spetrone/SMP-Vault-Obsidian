## **Define**

- **fire environment :** *the surrounding conditions, influences, and modifying forces that determine the behavior of a fire.*
	- **Fuel** - 
		- size and shape, 
		- quantity/load, 
		- chemistry, 
		- continuity, 
		- compactness, 
		- arrangement,
		- moisture content
	- **Weather** - 
		- wind speed, direction, 
		- RH,
		- precipitation,
		- temperature
		- , atmospheric stability
	- **Topography** - Topography refers to the arrangement of natural and artificial features of the landscape.
		- slope, 
		- aspect, 
		- elevation, 
		- terrain
		- barriers
		- topographic features
	

- **Fire behavior:** The manner in which fuel ignites, flame develops, and fire spreads and exhibits other related phenomena as determined by the interaction of fuels, weather, and topography.
	- ▪ Dissipates ▪ Decays ▪ Arrests ▪ Extinguishes
	- Evolved from fire response and suppression paradigm --> to behavior prediction

- **slope** - defined as rise/run * 100 (45 degrees is 100%)
	- spreads faster up a slope because it bends fire towards fuel, speeding up pyrolosis
	- **aspect:** direction the slope faces
	- **elevation/slope position** - height (m) of the terrain above mean sea level 9ASL)
		Elevation affects fire behaviour by influencing fuel type, the amount, and timing of precipitation, as well as exposure to prevaioling wind
		- affects seasonal drying

- **relative humidity** - RH is the percentage of moisture in a volume of air relative to the total amount of moisture that the volume of air can hold at the given temperature and atmospheric pressure
	- colder - can hold less - so relative humidity for same volume and atmospheric pressure is higher - air is more saturated
	- warmer - can hold more - so relative humidity for same volume and atmospheric pressure is lower
	- effect on fuel:
		- high RH - adds water to fuels by dampening them - less likely to burn
		- when low (< 30%) - air absorbs moisture from fuels, dehydrating them, making them more susceptible to ignition

- **wind direction** - the direction from which the wind is blowing (i.e. North wind is blowing from North to South)
	- wind - the horizontal movement of air

- **atmospheric stability** : enhancement or suppression of the vertical movement of air
	- stable atmosphere: suppresses/resists vertical movement of air
		- light winds and poor smoke dispersal
		- suppresses/reduces wildland fire behavior
	- unstable atmosphere : encourages / enhances vertical movement of air
		- promotes formation and growth of vertically developed clouds, thunderstorms and tall smoke columns
	- neutral atmosphere: neither suppresses nor enhances vertical movement of air

- **orographic lift :** lift over sloped/mountainous terrain
	- moist, warm air rises at (rainy) windward slope
		- moisture condenses, relative humidity increases
	- cool air depleted of moisture sinks and warms, relative humidity decreases
		- on dry, leeward slope
		- creates rain shadow on/after leeward slope

- **fuel moisture content :** Fuel moisture content is the amount of water in a fuel, expressed a percent of the oven-dry weight of the fuel:
	- (wet weight - dry weight) / dry weight * 100

- **foliar moisture content** : Moisture content of live foliage
	- follows seasonal pattern - spring dip (down to 85-100% before new flush)
	- 2-400%
	- 200-250% new conifer needles
	- 85-120% old needles
	- 200% deciduous

- **equilibrium moisture content :** when there is no net gain or loss of moisture between fuels and the surrounding air
	- Fuels moisture is dynamic and will move towards equilibrium 
	- ▪ Equilibrium is achieved at different rates 
	- ▪ The rate is quantified by the time lag, which describes the responsiveness of the fuels

- **time lag :** the amount of time necessary for a dead fuel particle to lose or gain 63% of the difference between its initial moisture content and its equilibrium moisture content *at a constant temperature and relative humidity.*
	- fine fuels have large SA:VOL ratio - short time lag
	- large fuels - lower SA:VOL ratio - longer time lag

## **List**

- **five stable /enduring fuel properties** - inherent properties that vary naturally by species:
	- size and shape
	- load (amount)
	- chemistry
	- arrangement
	- continuity/distribution
	- compactness
------- unstable:
- Moisture content 

- **six fuel strata**
	 - **canopy** - trees, snags, ladder fuels
	 - **shrubs** - shrubs, needle drape
	 - **herbaceous vegetation** - herbs, graminoids
	 - **woody fuels** - all wood, sound wood, rotten wood, stumps, and woody fuel accumulations
	 - **litter-lichen-moss** - litter, lichen and moss
	 - **ground fuels** - duff, basal accumulations

	

- **six topographic properties/descriptors that influence fire behavior**
	- Slope : rise/run * 100 --> 45 degrees is 100%
	- Aspect : the direction the slope faces
	- Elevation/slope position:
	- Topographical features:
	- Terrain:
	- Barriers:

## **Describe**

- the different scales of time and space associated with the: fire triangle, fire behavior triangle and fire regime triangle
	-  Fire processes play out at multiple scales and are influenced by complex feedbacks and controls operating at a range of ***temporal and spatial scales***
	- three triangles:
		1. **Flame Triangle:**(microsite cm to 500m2 - seconds, minutes)
			- Fuel
			- Oxygen
			- Heat
		1. **Wildfire Triangle** (local (m to ha): hrs, days, weeks)
			- Topography
			- Weather
			- Fuel
		2. **Fire Regime Triangle** (>500,000 ha decades, centuries)
			- Ignitions
			- Vegetation
			- Climate

- **how surface-area to volume ratio of the fuels affects fire behavior**
	- SA-volume ration affects moisture content change
		- lower SA:VOL --> slower moisture content change
		- higher SA:VOL --> faster moisture content change
		- **fine fuels** have a higher surface area to volume ratio than **heavy fuels**
	- affects time lag
		- higher SA:VOL --> shorter time lag
		- lower SA:VOL --> longer time lag

	
	- **heavy fuels** - e.g. logs, sumps, large branch wood, trees, deep duff
		- **longer to ignite, spread slowly**
		- **burn longer with greater intensity**
	- **fine fuels** - e.g. grass, dead leaves, tree needles, brush and small trees

- the difference between subsurface/ground, surface, ladder and aerial fuels (FUEL BED)
	- *depends on: - vertical position/arrangement* 
	- == **fuel bed***: *greatly influences behavior of fires*

1. **Sub-surface/ground 
	-  *slow burning, difficult to extinguish*
	- UNDERGROUND - roots, deep duff, decomposed  needles and other organic material, rotten buried logs, peat, partially decomposed organic matter

2. **Ladder**
	- *provide a path or "ladder" for a surface fire to mover into the over-story tree crowns*
	- Moderate-height vegetation directly adjacent to surface fuel layer: large shrubs, low-hanging branches, tree moss, tall grasses, downed dead limbs or logs.

3. **Surface** 
- flashy fuels - ignite easily and burn quickly
- Located on the ground or immediately above the ground: litter(undecomposed needles), moss, lichen, grass, small dead wood, downed logs, stumps, large limbs, and low vegetation (grass, herbs, small shrubs)

4. **Aerial/crown fuels**
- Crown fuels separated from the round and sometimes each other : live and dead foliage (tree needles), and other biomass in the upper canopy: small branch wood, lichen, snags, tall shrubs
- Burn rapidly due to air circulation

- **aspect** (topographic) and how it affects fuels, fuel moisture and potential fire behavior
	- the direction the slope faces
	- affects:
		- how much solar radiation is received
			- south/west slops - less vegetation, lighter fuel loads
			- south slopes - more solar radiation - fuel dries out sooner, more thoroughly
			- North slops - more vegetation - heavier fuel loads, can experience more severe wildfire
			- North slopes are cooler and more shaded - fuel drying is delayed
		- average temperature
		- earlier heating/cooling (E), later heating/cooling (W)
		- fuel moisture
		- curing of fuels (N later, S earlier)
		- snow melt (N later, S earlier)
		- rate of spread (N-slowest, S-highest)

- how wind affects fire behaviour
1. **Direct**
	- intensifies fire - increasing O2
	- bends flames - preheating and drying making new fuels susceptible to ignition
	- carries embers and sparks - more than a km ahead of fire
2. **Indirect**
	- strong, dry winds *absorb moisture* from fuels; cool winds can help them *retain moisture*
	- *residence time* - amount of fuel consumed via length of time flame front in area 
		- stronger wind - shorter residence time - less fuel consumed

- what happens to fire behaviour when a cold front passes over an active fire
