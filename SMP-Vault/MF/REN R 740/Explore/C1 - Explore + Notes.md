  ## **Define**

- **pyrolysis:**   the endothermic reaction breaking down organic compounds (such as cellulose, hemicellulose) prior to oxidation.

- **enthalpy**: for a thermodynamic system, it is the sum of the internal energy and the product of its pressure and volume - in simple terms - the measurement of energy in a thermodynamic system - the total heat of a system. 

- **endothermic reaction:**  a reaction for which the overall standard enthalpy change is positive - an increase in enthalpy - i.e. heat is absorbed. 

- **exothermic reaction:** reaction for which the overall standard enthalpy change is negative. Heat is released.

Spontaneity depends on enthalpy change, entropy change and absolute temperature - Gibbs free energy must be lower --> exergonic --> spontaneous

- **fire regime:**  the spatial and temporal patterns of fires and their effects over a given area in a given time period.
 
- **Fireline intensity:** the rate of heat transfer per unit length of the fireline (kW/m).

- **Fire type**: reflects the fuels involved in combustion and aligns with intensity

- **fire management:**  efforts to modify one or more of the basic elements of a fire regime, either directly or indirectly. 
	- Indigenous fire management
	- can you actually just change one at a time? - there is a cascading effect
	- another approach - getting the right amount of fire to the right places at the right time at the right cost.
		- e.g. constrain intensity with "controlled" burns in the spring

## **List** 

- **three things you need to start a fire:**
1. fuel
2. oxygen
3. heat

- **three mechanisms of heat transfer:**
1. convection
2. conduction
3. radiation

##### **Seven fire regime attributes:**
1. **Intensity**
2. **Type** (ground, surface, crown)
3. **Severity (effect)** - the effects of fire - often ecological focus, but can be socio-economic:
	- fuel consumption
	- tree scorch, char, mortality
	- atmospheric emissions
	- soil erosion
	- damaged structures
	- suppression costs
1. **Extent (size)**
2. **Cause** - ignition agent or source of the fire -  human, lightning
	- lightning more powerful and sustained ignition source than a human ignition
	-  generally, in Alberta, lightning is responsible for most area burned
	- human-caused fires - small - point source, whereas lightning-synchrony of many ignitions
		- closer to detection and response for human-caused fired
		- human-caused fire - dry spring conditions prior to greening up 
		- warming conditions + leafed-out condition - more lightning causes then
------------- 

6. **Frequency** - the number of times that fires occur within a defined are and time period . The amount of fire in an area.
	- **fire return interval** (only measurable in a non-stand-replacing fire regime)
		- for stand-replacing fires - can also look at stand ages (non-destructive) with spatial statistics
	- **fire rotation**: the time it would take to burn an area equal to  the area under consideration
	- **cycle:** average of the annual proportion burned
1. **Seasonality** - pattern of fire occurrence during the year

(*first five also fire descriptors at smaller scale - all seven = fire regime attributes)
+
1. Burned Area
2. Cycle
3.  **Return Interval :** The fire interval is the time between fires in a specified area - usually used at  a small spatial scale (i.e., a tree or stand)

**Purpose**
Fire regime attributes are used to :
1. **Compare** the role of fire between ecosystems
2. **Assess** the degree of departure from historical conditions
3. **Project** potential effects (management activities, changing climate, or other variables)

**The fire regime** describes the patterns of fire seasonality, frequency, size, spatial continuity, intensity, type (e.g., crown or surface fire) and severity in a particular area or ecosystem.

#### Three fire management domains
1. Policy and Planning
2. Prevention
3. Mitigation
	- fuel management (mitigation) is different from restoring surface fire ecosystems - kind of an abomination in crown fire ecosystems.
		- hope it to do it in a focused way to protect communities strategically, not widespread across and ecosystem.
		- attempts to consider under-burning - however these trees are not adapted and would likely die
			- also lower limb removal makes them top heavy more likely to fall over
1. Response
	1. preparedness
	2. detection
	3. suppression/containment
	4. large fire management
2. Recovery

 **top two two priorities for fire protection in Alberta:**
1. ***Human life***
2. ***Communities***
3. Watershed and sensitive soils
4. Natural resources
5. Infrastructure

**Wildfire Suppression Priorities:**
- contain fire spread by 10 am the day after it is detected
- start suppression activity before the fire grows larger than 2 hectares (4.9 acres) in size


## **Describe**

##### **The difference between fire frequency, fire return interval, and fire cycle:**  
Frequency is the number of fires in a given time period. The fire return interval is the time interval between the fires within a given time period. A fire cycle is the time required for the area equivalent to the size of an area of interest to burn.

#### Self-limiting properties of fire: - ecosystem memory
- the behavior and spread of a fire on a landscape will depend in part on the legacy of past fire events.
	- each fire alters the conditions for the next fire in the same location

##### - Fire Suppressions and the fire/size extent
- is fire suppression effective at reducing area burned? does it alter the fire regime?
	- common narrative - it can cause a build-up of fuels

- **stand level alteration of structure and arrangement** can alter surface fire regimes to crown fire regimes when surface fuels build up and there are not regular low-intensity fires - and all the built-up fuels go up at once with more intensity and become more like crown fires - not a natural regime

- **landscape-level alteration of ecosystems** - in *crown fire ecosystems * - e.g. Boreal* zones - if you suppress some of the fires - less of a mosaic of stand maturity - not a patchwork of diversity 
- affects self-limiting aspects of fire - but hard to determine quantitatively/ model - difficult to disentangle the plethora of variables.

##### The difference between crown fire and surface fire regimes:**
1. Ground : A fire that burns in the ground fuel layer (([CWFM Glossary](https://www.ciffc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-04/CWFM_glossary_v2023-04-24-EN.pdf))
	- intensity range <10 kW/m (lecture slides)
2. **Surface Fire:** A fire that burns in the surface fuel layer, excluding the crowns of the trees, as either a head fire, flank fire, or back fire ([CWFM Glossary](https://www.ciffc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-04/CWFM_glossary_v2023-04-24-EN.pdf))
	- intensity range: < 2500 kWm-1 ([Michaletz](obsidian://open?vault=SMP-Vault&file=MF%2FREN%20R%20740%2FReadings%2FC1%20Reading%2FBiophysical%20Processes%20(Reading%201a)))
3. **Crown fire**: A fire that advances through the crown fuel layer, usually in conjunction with a surface fire ([CWFM Glossary](https://www.ciffc.ca/sites/default/files/2023-04/CWFM_glossary_v2023-04-24-EN.pdf))
	 - intensity range: > 2500 kWm-1 ([Michaletz](obsidian://open?vault=SMP-Vault&file=MF%2FREN%20R%20740%2FReadings%2FC1%20Reading%2FBiophysical%20Processes%20(Reading%201a)))
	 - 
Crown fires are more intense and more severe, often having lethal effects on entire stands, whereas surface fires are less intense and less severe, often leaving medium and large trees alive (which are adapted to surface fires and generally have thick bark). Surface fire regimes burn small trees, grasses, and under-story vegetation whereas crown fires burn all the fine fuels in the crowns of trees (and typically occur alongside surface fires)

##### Fuel
*Assemblages of fuel and non-fuel elements and their physical properties alone and in relation to each other across space define the **fuel complex***

- size and shape
- quantity/load
- chemistry
- compactness
- arrangement
- moisture content

##### Weather
- wind speed, direction 
- relative humidity 
- precipitation
- temperature
- atmospheric stability 
##### Topography
- slope --> goes uphill faster - angle closer to fire front
- aspect --> south more dry fuel
- elevation --> temperature, moisture, fuel
- terrain 



### Ecosystems and Fire Regimes

- in general:
	- crown fire ecosystems have high severity fire regimes and specific species - black spruce, jack pine, lodgepole pine
	- surface fire ecosystems have low severity fire regimes and specific species adapted to those:
		- red pine, white pine, ponderosa pine, douglas fir
##### Black Spruce
- abundant in Canada
- High intensity, crown fire ecosystem
- boreal zone
- crown comes down to ground - like a wick

##### Jack of lodgepole pine
- **serotinous** cones: resinous bond between the cone and scales, such that they do not open at maturity
	- bonds break when subjected to temperatures of 45 to 50 C or higher - cones open and stored seed is released
- high crown but has a flaky bark that acts as a wick

##### Aspen
- spring surface fires before "green up"; typically surface fires
- it will burn as a crown fire with more intense fires
- adapted to regenerate after lethal fire
- regeneration from root suckers after stand has been killed by a fire

### Tree species adapted to Surface Fire / Low Severity Fire Regimes
1. White pine
2. Douglas Fir
3. Ponderosa Pine
4. Red Pine

- difficult to generalize fire regimes - not always either crown or surface
