**Define**

- decision time horizon
	- time that the predictions are for
	- minutes and hours - that is what the FBP system is for
	- uses outputs from FBP system
		- scroll down to brown bar in FBP online - that is what is used
			- just fire behavior prediction calculator
	- duration of prediction = time horizon
		- when evaluating consequences of the fire; how far in future
	- where it will be in next couple hours and how intense
	- short term decision horizon, over next day at most

- diurnal weather
	- diurnal variation in a weather element is the variation between a high  value and a low value that occurs during the same day  

	-   FFMC is  adjusted to an hourly value using either Lawson’s diurnal method or  hourly FFMC calculations developed by Van Wagner (detailed in Beck  and Armitage 2004, or Hirsch 1996)

	- fire follows a daily pattern based on daily/hourly weather
	- cool, high RH in morning suppresses fire activity
	- later in the afternoon and evening (peak burning conditions), the conditions are usually worse for a fire
	- old system had a diurnal adjustment, but now there is not a diurnal adjustment
		- the diurnal adjustment is built-in
- local standard time
-Standard time is the local time in a country or region when daylight  
saving time is not in use. Standard time is also known as winter time  
or normal time, while Local Daylight Time (LDT) may be  
called summer time

**List**

- the main sections commonly included in a fire case study outline
- three questions that managers ask about actual or predicted new fires

**Describe**

- the role of an FBAN
- credential for a fire behavior analyst - specialist position for planning for incident command system
- responsible for making prediction of probable fire behavior based on state of current and predicted environment conditions
	- used to dictate tactical decisions

- how and why wave propagation is used to simulate fire growth
	- to handle heterogeneity of fuels at the landscape level - to predict the area and perimeter of the fire
	- Huygens’ Treatise on Light

at next timestep - many small ellipses that may grow at different rates and directions depending on their local environment

- prometheus being modernized to apply this with Wildfire Intelligence and Simulation tool

- why Parks Canada ignited the Syncline prescribed fire

- the purpose of a burn-out operation and potential negative impacts of conducting a burn-out 

- the value of, approaches to and practical uses of fire case studies (refer to the readings)

**Explore**

- Try doing some fire behaviour predictions using the Red Book (available on the C5 Readings page). Compare your results to the outputs produced by the online F[ire Behaviour Prediction CalculatorLinks to an external site.](https://akff.mesowest.org/tools/fbp-classic/) . Use FBP System inputs documented in the Syncline Fire case study, or make up your own inputs to explore the differences between a Red Book prediction and one generated with the online calculator.


Notes:

![[Pasted image 20250211101726.png]]

Rate of Spread : accelerating rate of spread

Rare of Spread at end: equilibrium rate of spread

(not usually different for longer predictions - like 60 mins vs 10 mins)

- torching == intermittent crowning
