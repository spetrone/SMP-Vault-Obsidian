**Define**

*note that codes are arbitrary values - no units*
*based on a closed pine stand*

- **FFMC : Fine Fuel Moisture Code**
	- describes the fine fuels

- **DMC : Duff Moisture Code**
	- describes the duff - the loosely compacted organic layer that is 5-7 cm in depth - more likely for lightning ignition

- DC : Drought Code
	- describes heavily compacted and decomposed organics
	- not usually part of head fire - in drought conditions can cause deep smouldering

- ISI : Initial Spread Index
	- FFMC + wind

- BUI : Build Up Index
	- DMC + DC

- FWI : the system but ALSO a unique index
	- BUI + ISI -> overall measurement rating of intensity

- **empirical models**
	- **model**: A scientific model is a physical and /or mathematical and/or conceptual  representation of a system of ideas, events or processes.
	- built over many empirical measurements from observations rather than conceptual models and controlled experiments. 
	- regression then used on empirically measured data points to model a relationship


Analogues to Byram's equations (but CANNOT plug in!):
I : FWI
w: BUI -weight - build-up index
r : ISI - rate of speed - initial spread index

**List**

- **four weather inputs used to calculate FFMC**
1. Relative Humidity
2. Temperature
3. Precipitation
4. Wind

- **three weather inputs used to calculate DMC**
1. temperature
2. precipitation
3. relative humidity

- **two weather inputs used to calculate DC**
1. temperature
2. precipitation

- **three different applications of FWI System values** - fire management decision support
- Policy and planning
- prevention
- mitigation
- preparedness 
- response
	- detection, suppression

**Describe**

- the general model of moisture exchange used to calculate the FWI System fuel moisture codes
![[Pasted image 20250123101245.png|250]]


me = equilibrium moisture
mt = moisture content after an elapsed time
mo = initial moisture content
T = fuel's time lag

- ***the time lag associated with each fuel moisture code, the weather inputs that effect the time lag for each fuel moisture code and why the time lags for each fuel moisture code differ***

	- **time lag:** the amount of time necessary for a dead fuel particle to lose or gain 63 percent of the difference between its initial moisture content and its equilibrium moisture content at a constant temperature and relative humidity (i.e. the amount of time to lose 2/3 of its available moisture)

- ***weather:*** temperature, relative humidity, wind speed
	- Higher temps and lower RH or higher winds == faster reacting fuels
	- things dry faster on a hot windy day'
- ***fuel:*** 
	- surface-area-to-volume ratio (higher = faster drying)
	- large fuels, large time leg - env. conditions for drying need to stay constant for a longer period of time

- three different methods that could be used to calculate FWI System components
