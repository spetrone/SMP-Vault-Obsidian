**Explain**

- how slope is handled in the FBP System
- the buildup effect and what it is used for
- the difference between a point and line ignition when completing an FBP System prediction
- how the Boreal Mixedwood fuel type M-1/M-2 was developed and the modifier that is required when making predictions for that fuel type
- how the FBP System calculates fire area and perimeter

[FBP System Calculator - Use this to predict fire behaviour (outputs)](https://akff.mesowest.org/tools/fbp-classic/)

[FBP System Map Generator - Use this to visualize and map the predicted fire (do not use text or table outputs)](https://akff.mesowest.org/tools/fbp/)

 Complete at least 5 predictions with REDapp (vary the fuel type and other inputs to explore what happens to the primary and secondary outputs)

- For example, try some predictions in C-2  fuels with two different weather conditions:
    - Extreme: FFMC=95, BUI=90, wind 25 km/h. What is the ISI? Assume the fire starts at 16:00 on July 8th. How fast will it spread? How big will it be after 60 minutes? 
    - Low: FFMC=83, BUI=20, wind 5 km/h. How did your answers to the questions above change?
- Explore how increasing the percent conifer in a mixedwood stand changes predictions (for the same weather conditions above)
- Did any of the results surprise you?
