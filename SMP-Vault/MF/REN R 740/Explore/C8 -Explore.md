**Define**

- fire use:  Fire use is the initiation, facilitation or accommodation of  burned areas within a defined geographic location and time  period on the basis of a plan
	- in fire use situations, the decision maker predetermines the  criteria that must be met and the conditions under which an  area will burn (e.g., timing, season, fire weather)
	- fire use is supported by broad goals set out in fire management policies and by broad scale fire management zonation
	- two key planning tools are used to define detailed objectives, strategies and tactics for  fire use:  
		- - Strategic fire management plans  
		- Tactical prescribed fire burn plans

- **goals:** what you’d like to accomplish  
	*Example: maintain a natural fire cycle without*  
	*undermining public safety or threatening values*

- **objectives:** Objective: your goal articulated in a measurable way  
	*Example: burn target of 2,500 hectares annually within*  
	*designated zones to emulate natural fire cycle*

- **Strategy:** the general approach or method to meet objectives  
	*Example: vary fire management by designated zones:*  
	*prescribed fire zone, let-burn zone, full-suppression zone*

- **Tactics:** specific actions to implement the strategy  
	*Example: required weather and fuel conditions for*  
	*igniting a specific prescribe fire in a specific location.*  
	*Specify the sequence and pattern of ignitions, planned*  
	*control lines, logistics, contingency plans etc..*

**Zonation** has long been used by fire management  jurisdictions to delineate geographic areas with  varying fire management goals and objectives

- capping unit : Typically involve small prescribed fires that reinforce natural boundaries to reduce  the wildfire spread potential through an entire valley and into the adjacent land management unit.

- prescribed fire

**List** 

- *11 fire use contexts*
	- Response – fire suppression and containment  
	- Prevention and mitigation – hazard fuel reduction/removal,  enable natural fire-vegetation dynamics/feedbacks  
	- Restoration – re-establish a natural fire regime, promote  natural ecological functioning  
	- Wildlife habitat enhancement  
	- Grazing/rangeland management  
	- Silviculture – site preparation  
	- Land clearing, debris removal  
	- Insect and disease management  
	- Social and cultural practice  
	- Research  
	- Training and skills development

- *3 common fire management zone types*
- *there are other policies nested within these zones commonly*
	1. Intensive or managed fire zone
		1. ALBERTA: All wildfires will be responded to and managed to accomplish specific  resource objectives as outlined in an approved management plan or  standard operating procedures  
			- Immediate suppression is the objective for all wildfires  
			- Timely and effective initial attack strategies will be used to contain wildfires within the first burning period.
			- Between 2002 and 2012, the province had areas designated as Ecological  Wildfire Management Zones (EWMZ) --> discontinued
		1. Aggressive fire suppression efforts in Canada have been  concentrated around communities and in areas with infrastructure, commercially valuable timber resources, or industrial developments (Intensive Zone
		2. Due to **limited resources**, fire management agencies  prioritize their response activities *within the Intensive*  Zone in some situations - focus on fires affecting communities -prioritize fires based on threatening values or if they may be ecologically beneficial to restore patchwork of heterogeneity of age classes
		3

		-  
			- Some Forest Areas have defined local containment areas  
			- Even under a full suppression policy, fires are sometimes allowed to burn  when fire loads exceed resource capacity

	2. Extensive or natural fire zone
		1. limited fire suppression - most fire burns unmanaged;
		2. Extensive Zone, the majority of fires are  monitored or observed
	3. Measured/intermediate zone
	- Measured Zone response to fires is determined on a case-by-case basis




- typical components of a park or wilderness area fire management plan 
	- Management Goals
		- ecological integrity, landscape values
		- community protection
		- forest health, mountain pine beetle control
		- natural fire processes
	- Natural Fire Zone
		- avoid interference with natural fire processes
		- limited suppression and minimal use of suppression resources
		- each fire is assessed to determine if it can be allowed to burn given fire condition and risk
		- ecological values at risk considered
	- Managed Fire Zone
		- full suppression of all fires

1. Wildfire Management Strategy – outlines pre-suppression  
preparations, fireline organization, the process for initial attack and  
subsequent wildfire actioning, fire monitoring procedures, constraints on  
the use of particular techniques or equipment, and restoration or  
rehabilitation of burned areas  
1. Prescribed Fire Strategy – outlines approved prescribed burns, criteria  
for selecting additional prescribed burn locations, air quality and smoke  
management, and monitoring procedures

14C8-Fire use and prescribed fire

- capping units
- fuelbreaks/containment lines


- 4 different ignition methods 
	-  fusee
	- drip torch
	- helitorch
	- aerial ignition device (ping pong machine)

- 2 ignition patterns (techniques)
	
	- strip ignition pattern
	- centre fire ignition pattern

**Describe**

- the difference between appropriate response and fire zonation for supporting fire use objectives
- . - Ontario had: zonation, then more granular zones based on more variables, then completely threw out their zones, and went to "appropriate response" instead of using zones.
	- depends on each fire
	- more areas of province opened to fire use
	- opened more areas to potentially intensively suppress
	- ***figured out at the time the fire ignites***
		- quite a lot of real-time analysis and information, not entirely feasible, do we have enough data?
		- most risk-averse is to try to put it out
		- on what basis could you decide to let it go; possible depending on real-time information; must be very confident to make that decision.

- the difference between a backfire and a burnout operation
	-  backfire - against the wind - up against a control line
		- burnout - with the wind - away from a control line
	- how fire regime condition classes relate to fire use

- Take a look at one of the example burn plans posted on the C8 Readings page. What are the objectives of the burn? What is the fire prescription? What is the complexity rating and how was it determined? 

- Compare the example burn plan you chose to the other one posted online. Are the contents similar? If not, in what ways do they differ?

Historically - white zone not managed by province, only FPA, but now the province will be taking on the white areas - which were historically managed by municipalities and feds
	- these are not in the data - adds noise to data



- complexity rating - used to determine level of expertise
- prescribed not controlled
