**Define**

- **the parts of a fire**
	- **front**
		- fastest moving, with wind and slope
		- greatest flame length, depth, and rate of spread
	- **back**
		- opposite the head
		- slowest
		- shortest flame lengths
	- **flanks**
		- roughly parallel to main direction of spread
		- less alignment with wind than the head
		- reduced intensity and rate of spread
	- **finger**
		- long narrow extensions of a fire that project from the main body of the fire
	- **bay/pocket**
		- unburned indentations in the fire edge formed by fingers or slow burning areas
	- **island**
		- unburned islands are isolated areas within the burned area of the fire where fuels were not combusted
	- **fire perimeter**
		- marks the division between burned and unburned areas - generally the outside edge of the fire (can also delineate interior unburned islands)

- **the parts of a flame**
	- flame height: vertical height to tip of flame
	- flame angle: angle between flame and surface ground
	- depth of burn : depth in the ground burned by the flame
	- flame depth : the depth of the flame parallel to the ground, at the surface
	- flame length: the total flame length, dependent on flame height and flame angle; same as flame height when flame angle is 90d

- **fuel load :** the weight of combustible biomass per unit area

- **fuel bulk density :** the amount of fuel available to burn per unit volume

- **critical surface fire intensity:** the intensity of a fire needed for the onset of crowning
	- determined by: the canopy base height, foliar moisture content

- crown/canopy base height:
	- ***canopy base height (CBH):*** the height of the base of the live canopy above the ground

- four methods of estimating rate of spread
	1. direct observation
	2. in-stand measurement
	3. photo/video/infrared
	4. estimate from empirical data/statistical relationships

- the different types of fine surface fuels that would be consumed by the passage of the fire front  
	- understory conifer & shrubs
	- low vegetation (grass, herbaceous material)
	- fine woody material
	- litter (needles, leaves, moss, lichen)
	- duff (sometimes top 1cm)
	- mulch
    
- two emerging technologies for measuring crown/canopy fuels
	1. lidar
	2. hemispherical photography - rapid fuel assessment

**Describe**

- the limitations of estimating fire intensity from flame length
	- does not apply well to crown fires as crowns are a considerable distance above the ground; would underpredict flame length for crown fire
	- "elusive parameter in the eye of the beholder" - readily apparent to fire personel, but poor quality in terms of precise measurement in the field
- the photo-load method of fuel measurement:
	1. **surface:**  using human perception to differentiate relative fuel loads based on  comparisons with images with quantified fuel loads
	2. **canopy**: using an image of a transect to determine the vertical distribution of fuels

- how surface fuel consumption is measured in the field and key limitations of those measurements
	- litter: 10x 10cm samples oven dried to calculate bulk density and fuel load
	- fine woody debris: line intercept method for diametre to classify it
	- shrubs: percent cover % - some of all distances for a species / total transect length; fuel load using shrub biomass equation =
	- (0.62689 + 0.05778 * 20 * 20)
	- photoload
	- **Limitations**: 
		- transects difficult to keep straight
		- difficult to maneuver through the forest
		- significant variation in three dimensions in a forest, transect does not cut it
