- duration effects ROS effects intensity - result will be sensitive to short timelines
	- ROS will be not at equilibrium
	- provides two rates of spread
		- before equilibrium
		- at equilibrium

- line ignition
	- already at equilibrium 

- prescribed burning ==  **line ignition**, at equilibrium
- duration does not really matter

FBP system in R - default is line ignition (accel = 0), otherwise with point ignition, put a long duration
