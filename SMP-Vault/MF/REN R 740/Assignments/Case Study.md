**Part A** - split between group
	- decide who is doing what
	- then integrate it as a report in the end
**Part B** - each will do it individually used on inputs from fire
- sensitivity analysis - e.g. of wind
	- repeat with other values, e.g. if 10, repeat with 5 and 50

Presentation - 20% of mark


- tables:
	- counts of hectares burned within buffer
	- counts of hectares burned outside buffer
	- make comparison


- should have a line graph, bar chart, and pie chart somewhere in the report
- bar graph - precipitation 
- line chart -temperature

- show fuel proportions with a pie chart
- can include tables


Fire Behavior:
- fuel types
- predictions for each of the dates from weather information for first x days
- describe changes
- might not need to do if for every day
	- e.g. 3 before
	- 3 days before under control
	- 3 days before extinguished 
- can use pictures
	- put timestamp and description for photo - to see if it matches the prediction


Part B
- do a sensitivity analysis to see what changes prediction the most
- see C6 for example
- wind direction 
- determine elipse
	- distance to head + L:B ration
- use own fire type 
	- actual ignition : coordinates that were given
- sketch - can be screenshot / digital
	- must be a map - scale and compas
