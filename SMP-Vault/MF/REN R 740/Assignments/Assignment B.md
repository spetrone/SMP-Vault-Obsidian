- current planning - take away fuel to reduce intensity -> WHY?
	- inhibit combustion on canopy growth fuels - as they are way more intense and hard to fight on the ground 
		- keep on surface and prevent ignition into the canopy
	- canopy fuels create embers
- HOW - treated areas
	- thin understory - spacing of 3m
	- pile it and burn it or remove it from site (more expensive)
		- do it in the winter
	- reduce canopy bulk density by thinning the overstory - less fuel in that volume block
	- raise canopy base height
		- e.g. - prune branches to 2m
		- removes ladder fuels, removes some canopy
- Example by slave lake
	- hand thinning with chainsaws
	- felled trees were removed
	- surface fuels mulched and distributed at site
	- CBH was raised by selectively removing small trees during thinning
	- crews measured the fuels in the treatment area plot pre and post-treatment


litter and 
duff - full depth #RENR740hint


### Purpose
- Are fuel treatments effective, and how effective?
	- what are the limitations - e.g. wind
- are we reaching the critical threshold for CSI to spread to crown
- **Is the treatment effective***
## ASSUMPTIONS

- which cells do you count? -- what is burned by default 
	- do you count the duff (e.g. duff depth)
		- kg/m^2 but you only want to the top cm (but given the whole depth e.g. 4.1) - so take top 1 cm extracted out of that 
		- take 1cm/total cm * duff(kg/m^2) or just take depth/duff kg/m^2
