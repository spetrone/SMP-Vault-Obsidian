- fire scenario
- 
Part 1
- not looking for tons of information
- demonstrate that we can apply characteristics to describe a fire and environment to describe a fire
	- only so much information - work with what we have
	- there are some unknows, can make assumptions; state assumptions
	- reference fire scenario pdf by slide (somewhat informal)

Part 2:
calculate proportion for the whole dataset which is the whole fire season
- proportion and not a count

**Case study** - look at background here in these slides (assignment A)
	- location
		- reference points - towns, province, etc.
	- then zoom in and provide more detail - load it into google earth and look at imagery
	- images during fire
		- arrows provide reference points
	- imagery before/after fire
		- e.g. google earth pro - with history function
		- winter and fall shows what has been consumed
		- look at vegetation - e.g. deciduous vs coniferous
	- Fire report
		- time of ignition
	- weather station
		- closest
		- 47km from location of fire
	- fire weather observations  (see list in slides)
		- look at codes and indices
		- look at pictures in notes slides with fwi
	- understand wind direction in degrees
		- #renr740exam 
	- MAPS:
		- google 

part 1 
look at spatial representation on a map

part 2
- spatial and temporal dynamics
	- time of year
	- amount of daylight
	- differences in climate between station and fire
	- rain can be patchy 
		- there can definitely be dry pockets out there
		- filled in as some continuum with interpolation
		- temperature is better with inverse distance weighting
- local knowledge needed, experience, intuition, understanding of data
- interpolated onto a map - the gradient is not precise - interpolated to cells
	- especially in early spring when weather stations not started and there are hugs distances between stations
- must understand how information was devised and its limitations
