April 7 - Dan Binkly

- write down what we are hearing in social media commentary about California fires


not California fires - but Jasper fires
"fires burning in an unprecedented manner"
"mega fires" - Forest Ecologist

specific to national parks:
"proactive stewardship could have prevented it - we have an obsession with preserving" Professional Forester
"wilderness in national parks is no-touch - none had ever been no-touch until colonization" Indigenous Forest Ecologist
"fire suppression and not preventative measures because it is a National Park and it is too close to people and users" - Forest Ecologist

"
- work through C1 explore
- Read up on Fire Regimes
- Do Readings

- Approach scientific papers:
	- read abstract - very effective summary
	- then  jump to discussions and conclusions
	- probably not a big need to jump into methods and analysis of paper
