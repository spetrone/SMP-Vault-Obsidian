Andreaeida and Sphagnidae

- lantern-like sporangia - 4 longitudinal splits along side at maturity - open with when dry but close when wet
- leaves panduriform (distinctive), unistratose
- leaf cells thick walled, short, often with single papillae
- microscopic - leaves have thick walls


*Andreaea rupestris*
- most frequent speies
- small - maybe a cm wide
- stems all erect
- dark green in colour - almost appear black
- grow on acidic substrates
- circumboreal species
- mostly on acidic rock in the Rockies, and in the NE in the shield that has a lot of acidic rock

*Andreaea Nivalis*
- only reddish Andreaea
- grows close to snow pits - requires snow runoff
- leaves are sick-shape and all turned to one side
	- felcatish?
- only in the rockies in Alberta
- apline and montane region - restricted to mountainous regions - common also in BC

## spghagnum
- spreading and hanging branches
	- occur in groups (fascicles)
- - distinctive gametophyte morphology 
- Capitulum or head
- branches in clusters fascicles
	- comprise hanging branches and spreading branches
- leaves differentiated into branch/stem leaves -unistratose
- Leaf cells - differentiate to hyaline and green cells
	- hyaline cells - non-living, empty, pores in wall, strengthened by fibrils or thickenings
	- green cells are living, provide metabolic functions
- differentiate species by looking at where broad side of triangular cell is
	- which side of leaf


*Spghanum angustifolium*
- in many bogs in alberta
- light green 
- size of capitlum is 1 cm or a little bit more
- identification --> double/paired  hanging branches
- when dry - all leaves are wavy; at least leaf margin is wavy
- in ombotrophic bogs in Alberta
- in sphagnum humus and peat plateaus

*Sphagnum caillifolium*
- really dark - reddish to a lighter (color of angustifolium)
- grows in ombotrophic bogs (same as ^) growing in patches in the humics
	- more prominently in a hollow closer to the water table
- only one hanging branch in the capitulum

*Sphagnum divinum*
- shiny bright red (when healthy)
- big fat concave leaves
- in ombotrophic bogs, widespread in Alberta
- likes to be close to the water table (in same area of two above)
- cucilate?? leaves == shape?

*Sphagnum fuscum*
- brown, everything is brown
- grows in humics - form humics
- very densely packed
- to confirm - take all branches off stem and stem will be dark brown, almost black - always
- small capitlum - 1 cm at most
- branches will be very dense along stem - looks very shaggy
- another ombotrophic bog species (prevelant in Alberta)

*sphagnum riparium*
- NOT in ombotrophic bog
- capitulum 1.5 cm 
- usually a dark green
- always floating in water - in pools
- has apical/terminal bud that is very big, i tis pointy
- found in fens, sometimes ditches, always in pools of water rather than in humics

*sphagnum squarrosum*
- bigger one
- very light green colour
- leaves are squarerose (90 degrees to stem)
- have a big apical bud - unllike riparium it is rounded at the top
- not ombitrophic, more in eutropphic
- alder soil, with tamaracks, edge (but not middle) of fens, in ditches

*Sphagnum Teres*
- small 
- capitulum 0.5 cm at most
- has an apical bud (sometimes hidden by branches)
- very fine, minimal branching
- stem should be read (if you remove leaves to see colour)
- usually in moderate-rich fens; likes higher pH
- forms humics but smaller than first few sphagnums
	- may be a metre high and more than a metre across 
	- usually all teres when they do
	- also at edges of fens

*sphagnum wartorfii*
- colour: red
- 0.5 - 1 cm capitulum 
- not super dense
- in rich fens
	- very high pH
- anywhere with a basic pH too - can be in odd spots; also in forested areas
- leaves are in rows; often tips dry out and turn white
- five distinct rows on every branch and spiral along branch

- more carpets or small humics
