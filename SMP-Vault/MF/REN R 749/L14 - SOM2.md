- lower pH in mull is caused by mineral content

Db, OM%, C/N ratio, pH, CEC, Base Saturation


Cause of high CEC in MOR - from high OM%
Base saturation: consistent with pH


![[Pasted image 20250307091043.png]]Microorganisms, bacteria, fungi, nitrification

- bacteria prefer high pH, basic
- fungi prefer low pH, high acidity
- nitrification controlled by OM type
	- low rate in strongly acidic conditions - typical in Boreal forest (Mor type of humus form)
		- often under detection limits 
	-  it is because there is less bacteria performing the nitrification process

- nitrogen is in organic rings structures of complex organic molecules - very difficult to remove

### Organic Matter Fractions by chemical and physical criteria
- type determines nutrient availability
	- depends on molecular weight
	- C/N ratio 
	- humic or humic acid - needs more decomposition steps

- biomass - living
- detritus - identifiable dead tissues
- humus
	- nonhumic substance
		- group of biomolecules produced through microbial processes
		- unstable, don't last for very long
	- hnumic substances - main component of humus
		- classification depends on solubility in alkaline vs acidic solutions
		- humin - insoluble in alkali
		- humic acids - insoluble in acid
			- complex, non-uniform molecules; high molecular weight
		- fulvic acids - soluble in acid - yellow red
			- lower molecular weight

#### Decomposition of Organic compounds
affected by:

- anaerobic soils
	- oxidative processes
	- releases CO2, H20, energy
	- occurs slowly and is incomplete; many intermediate products
	- incomplete oxidation in anaerobic soils
- environmental conditions that favour decomposition:
	- near neutral pH
	- sufficient soil moisture
	- good aeration
	- warm temperatures (25-35C) - for microbe, higher than plants
- Litter quality
	- surface placement of residues (such as forest litter) usually results in slower, more variable rates of decomposition
		- contact variation
		- variable temperature
		- variable moisture
		- less buffer to the environment
	- C/N ratio - chemical quality of the litter
		- indicator of quality
	- particle size of residue
	- content of other nutrients


- N-dynamics during litter decomposition
	- leaching stage - reduction in N content
		- decrease depends on ecosystem type
	- accumulation stage - nitrogen increases until it reaches its limit
		- microbial activity
			- have much lower C:N ratio ~10
			- litter has high C:N ration 30 -50 
				- each cycle of decomposition makes more microbes from litter, which alters ratio
				- uptake nitrogen from soil solution, increasing the nitrogen concentraion' they are colonizing the litter surface, taking up more N in the soil solution and adding it to surface litter

- microbes like low C:N ratio food
- increased CO2 releaes - decomposition occuring
- only when C:N ratio decreases to a certain degree will you see a net release of N

## Natural and Managed Processes that alter the forest floor
- natural : wildfire, windthrow, fossorial mammals
- managed: timber harvesting, slash burning, site preparation, prescried burning, fertilization, drainage, thinning
	- fertilization: (with Nitrogen) may cause a reduction in forest floor from two effects:
		- decrease C:N ratio - and can therefor enhance microbial activity
		- enhance growth rate - productivity of the forest which could contribute to organic matter input
	- drainage
		- influence rate of decomposition; good drainage - removes excess water and prevents anaerobic conditions
		- will also increase the productivity of trees (maintainin aerobic conditions)
		- increase input of organic materials
	- thinning 
		- change environmental conditions
		- mechanical influence - mixing of organic horizons - similar to timber harvesting
		- cohort of organic matter returned to soil
			- one time event
		- canopy interception - less canopy cover, potentially less organic matter input
	- timber harvest
		- mechanical
		- some residue returned to soil from slash
