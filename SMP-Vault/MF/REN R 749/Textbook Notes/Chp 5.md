- trees root primarily in **vadose zone** - from surface to water table
- **capillary fringe** - the subsurface layer in which groundwater seeps up from the water table by capillary action to fill pores
	- pores at base filled with water due to tension saturation
	- saturated portion less than total capillary rise - from mix of pore spaces
		- small, even pores - may be a much larger capillary fringe (several feet) with irregular upper boundary
		- pore space large - even boundary, only a few inches
- **phreatic zone** - zone of soil rock that contains water table
	- filled with water; fluid pressure > atmospheric pressure

#### Physical properties:
- soil texture - size of mineral particles
	- soil structure : 3D conglomeration of mineral particles and organic matter
	- pore space - water infiltration, atmospheric composition, root penetration
	- bulk density
	- effects on water potential (held under negative potential)

- soil physical properties, esp. in vadose zone, profoundly influence the growth and distribution of trees through their effects on soil moisture regime, aeration, temperature profiles, soil chemistry and accuulation of SOM

- topography and accumulation of soil increases water on slope toes and increases water holding capacity - very different long term effects / legacies on these soils.


## Soil Mineral Texture 
 Mineral soil texture (distribution of particle sizes)
 - sands
 - siltts
 - loams
 - clays
- (all unde 2mm - over 2mm == cobbles - up to 80% in mountain forest soils)

**soil texture** and plant growth - indirect effect
- coarse (sandy) soils support more xeric plants
- finer soils support more mesic plants

## Soil Structure

3 Variables: ***type, size, grade***

soil structure moderates the effects of soil texture (aggregation into larger, coarser units)
- reduces bulk density
- alters distribution of pore sizes
	- alters water movement
	- alters water holding capacity
	- alters aeration
- moderation effect examples:
	- in coarse soil, aggregation increases water holding capacity
	- in finer soil, aggregation decreases water holding capacity but increases infiltration and aeration
### 1.  descriptors/**types:**
	- platy
	- prismatic
	- columnar
	- angular blocky
	- sub-angular blocky
	- granular
	- crumb
	- single grain
	- massive
### 2. - s**izes of aggregates**:
	- very fine
	- fine
	- medium
	- coarse
	- very coarse
#### 3. structural classes - from comparing representative groups of peds with set of standardized diagrams
- **grade:** relative stability and durability of the aggregates & ease of separation from one another

#### Drivers of aggregation: 
- mineral chemistry, salts, clay skins, oxide coatings, growth and decay of fungal hyphae and roots, freezing and thawing, wetting and drying, and the activity of soil organisms (especially earthworms)
	- soil animals
		- ingest mineral matter and SOM producing casts that provide structure
		- intermediate products of microbial synthesis and decay stabilize soil
		- resistant humus components form complexes by cementing action
		- tree species - aggregate size increased with increasing fungal mass and decreasing bacteria biomass

#### Bulk Density
- dry mass (of <2mm material) of a given volume of intact soil measured in Megamgras per cubic meter (kg/L)
- related to soil texture - but differences in soil structure can override texture
- usually between 2.60 - 2.75; some forest soils 0.2 in organic layers, and 1.9 in coarse sands.
- influences are organic matter, porosity, compaction
- effects of compacted soil:
	- high strength
	- rested root penetration
	- reduced aeration - depress root activities, aerobic microbes, animals
	- reduced water infiltration rates - anaerobic conditions in puddled areas
- lower bulk density - more productive soil


#### Pores
- **Pore volume**: the portion of soil volume filled by water or air  - relative proportions are dynamic
	- note that gas diffuses about 10,000 times faster through air than through water
- Distribution of pore size in a soil may be broad - mix of capillary and noncapillary pores
	- sandy surface soils - pore volume of 35-50%,
	- medium-to-fine textured soils have a pore volume of 40-60%
	- Compact subsoil - may be as low as 25-30%
	- Flora and fauna affect pore sizes and distributions
- coarse sands - larger pores than clay, but less total pore space
- **Capillary pores** (small diameter)
	- increase water holding capacity
	- slow infiltration
	- increase chance of being waterloffed
- **Noncapillary pores**
	- increase aeration
	- increase infiltration
	- decrease water-holding capacity


### Forest vs. agricultural soils
- cultivation reduces organic matter and macro pore space therefore forest soils often have greater pore volume
	- aggregates generally more stable under forested conditions than under cultivation - mechanical rupturing of aggregates and reduction of SOM and associated cementing from microbial and fungal exudates
- flow types:
	- **preferential flow:** the ability of soils to transmit water rapidly from the surface to deeper into the soil profile
	- **matric flow:** when water moves through tiny spaces between particles retarded by interactions with the surfaces
