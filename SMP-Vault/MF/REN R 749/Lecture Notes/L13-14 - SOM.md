Forest Floor (FF)
- == duff & humus
- FF - All dead OM including litter and inincorporated humus resting on a mineral surface

 
 
- **L: Litter,** freshly fallen or only slightly decomposed leaves, twigs, stems, flowers, fruits and bark
		- Average composition (%m/m: foliage 60-70, mon-foliage 27-31, understory litter 3-28

- **F: Fragmented** (fermented - term going out of favour): partially decomposed OM
- **H: Humus**, the relatively stable fraction of SOM after a major portion of plant and animal residues have decomposed; usually amorphous and dark-colored


### Functions of FF:
- H20 retention and movement (infiltration)
- Energy exchange and soil temperature
	- insulate mineral soil from cold air from penetrating the soil
	- could be positive or negative depending on whether it is better/worse to have soil temperature changed
- Nutrient cycling
	- fauna and microorganisms concentrated
	- tree nutrition - most nutrients are contained in the forest floor
		- not many roots in the forest floor; some do, but majority do not
		- many micro-organisms for mineralizing nitrogen are in mineral soil and cannot access the nitrogen in forest floor
		- organic nitrogen sitting on top - mostly in organic nitrogen form; has a very high C:N ration == poorly available, longer process for nitrogen to become available
			- in chernozemic soil, the nitrogen has already gone through several cycles of decomposition, so the C:N ratio is much smaller, and more available
		- nitrogen in forest floor layers - subject to loss through fire
		- disturbances could cause more erosion and runoff of the organic matter with nitrogen
- Protection from water erosion - raindrop impact
- protection from soil puddling and surface crusting
- seedling establishment
- fuel - prescribed fire
- soil C sequestration to affect global C cycling and global warm - but it is not stable in the system; it is susceptible to losses - e.g. by fire

## Humus Form Classification (morphological)
- L horizon is not part of diagnostic horizon
	- L still part of classification system
- a morphologically-based classification of humus layers occurring under forest plant communities
- Two broad groups
	- (upland) **Terrestrial** or upland humus forms: developed under well-drained to imperfectly-drained conditions
	- (wetland)**Hydromorphic** or semi-terrestrial humus forms: developed under poorly-drained conditions or water saturation most of the year
- Use characteristis of three organic horizons (3 diagnostic horizons):
	- F - partially decomposed OM, some of original plant structures difficult to recognize. Fragmented or partly decomposed with fungal mycelia.
	- H - humified OM
	- Hi - H intermixed with mineral particles
- ![[Pasted image 20250305092509.png]]
## Basis of humus form classification:
- Morphology that reflects differences in factors and processes during formaiton
	- presence or absence of diagnostic organic horizons i.e. F, H
	- Degree of incorporation of fine humus with mineral soil, i.e. Hi
		- generally mechanical mixing from fauna
	- Degree of chemical association of organic and inorganic matter i.e. Ah
		- i.e. there has been chemical eluviation/movement of organic matter to mineral horizons
	- Difference between organic and inorganic soil: 17% C (carbon)

1. which form: Upland/hydromorphic : look at thickness of organic horizons
	- >40 cm thickness : semi-terrestrial or hydromorphic form
		- otherwise, upland site
		- same cut-off for classifying a soil as an organic soil
2. is F or H there or lacking
	 - lacking == mull; mixed into mineral soil to form an Ah horizon 
	 - not lacking - look at relative dominance of the Hi horizon
		 - No Hi - sharply deliminated - Mor
		 - Hi - how prominent is the Hi horizon vs the F horizon
			 - F not prominent/Hi prominent - Moder
			 - F prominent/Hi not prominent - Raw Moder

- Conditions determine how quickly OM will decompose
- Mull - transition diffuse
- Mor - transitions are typically distinct; a lot of organic acids, destabilizing clay, OM, and leach them out, forming an Ae horizon

## 3 Humus Forms

* Note:  Organic matter == **1.7** x organic Carbon

#### **Mull:** well to imperfectly well-drained sites, extensive decomposition of litter and formation of organo-clay complexes. 
KEY FACTOR: for organo-clay complex: strong activities of soil fauna such as earthworms (therefore limited region in souther ON, QC - St. Lawrence Lowland; mean annual soil temp ~8C)
- not common in Boreal forest, and so not common in AB, SK, MN
- much more fertile soils compared to boreal soils
- resembles chernozemic soil
- medium to rich site

- Lack diagnostic horizons –
- Dark gray to black, porous –
- Organo-clay complex (not visible except with microscope)
- OM 5-25%, usually 12-18% –
- Gradual transition to underlying horizons –
- Granular structure common 
- Occurrence –
	- Temperate deciduous forests, e.g., sugar maplebasswood –
	- Earthworm activity 
	- Gray-Brown Luvisols


#### Moder : Moder: well to imperfectly well-drained sites, slow litter decomposition. 
- OM and minerals may be intermixed or sharply separated, but no organoclay complex (vs mull).
- has organic diagnostic horizons

- Thin F horizon, prominent Hi  
- no organo-clay complexes, because not of clay; too coarse
- Usually 40-50% OM,
- slow incorporation of humus into mineral (vs mull), but there is incorporation 
- Acid, low base saturation 
	- will slow-down decomposition rate; which will release more organic acid as a result of incomplete decomposition; feedback cycle, where it gets more acidic, then breaks down less, gets more acidic.
	
- Occurrence –
	- Mixedwood or hardwood forests, northern hardwoods
		- hardwood/deciduous trees have higher concentrations of Ca in litter, which counteracts some of the acidity to some extent
	- Soils with surface mineral horizons of low clay content, under temperate climate – Soils on steep slopes 
	- mixing by soil creep

##### Moder: subtypes 
- **Mull-like moder** - transition to moder
	- transition to mull –
	- Prominent Hi, OM >30% (if <30% OM, mineral soil), thin F – Both earthworms and microarthropods –
- Occurs where low clay content prevents formation of mull – absence of organo-clay complex 
- **(Typical) Moder** 
	- Prominent Hi (5-10 cm), F thin (1-3 cm) 
	- Humus granules as casts of microarthropods mixed with mineral particles 
	- Dystric Brunisols: yellow birch – sugar maple stands 
		- 
- **Raw moder  - transition to mor** - higher acidity
	- Prominent F, thin Hi –
	- Develops under acid pH and low base saturation –
	- Casts of microarthropods disintegrate 
	- Eluviated Dystric Brunisols and some Podzolic soils (more acidic)


#### Mor or raw humus: 
- well to imperfectly drained sites. 
- Organic horizons sharply separated from mineral soil. 
-  F often with fungal mycelia 
-  Lies unmixed over mineral Ae 
	- Relative thickness of F and H horizons vary depending on biological activity and nutritional conditions; also dependent on acidity of soil
- Faunal droppings scarce, incomplete decomposition of OM 
- 
- Occurrence 
	- Boreal coniferous forests, on a variety of parent material 
	- Temperate deciduous forests 
	- Even warmer climates on soils of low clay, low base saturation and dry



- *Mycelia like acid conditions; bacteria like more neutral conditions*
