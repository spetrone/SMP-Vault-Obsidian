- **frost action** - general term describing anything involving freezing and soil activities/cycles (include the two below)
- **cryoturbation** :
	- frost action in action in the permafrost region, where it is being thawed in the summer and frozen in the winter, in the "active" zone of the permafrost; that zone has its soil structure and profile altered by this activity
	- dominant soil-forming process in cryosoils 
- frost heaving :
	- raising of ground surface due to the formation of ice near the surface. Will then be dropped when ice thaws.
		- specific kind of ice:  lense ice
- Types of soil ice formation
	- ***Lens ice*** (needle ice, stalactite ice, comb ice - all the same, just different names): - frost heaving 
		-  slow freezing
		- comb-like
		- near soil surface
		- has to be water coming upwards from the deeper soil
	- ***Concrete ice:*** water freezes in place in soil pores: rapid freezing - little movement of soil
		- when temperature is so low, the cold temperature will transfer so quickly, ice will form in place - no opportunity for ice to come up  like with lense ice
			- in place, no water moving up, therefore not frost-heaving


## Frost Heaving Process

#### Definition:
- water is being raised 2-3cm below the soil surface - very close to the soil surface
	- below that is the accumulation of ice

#### Requirements:
- negative a few degrees, -10, maybe -20, but more is too cold
- freezing of soil water; requires an abundant availability of soil water
- susceptible soil  == silty (silt, silt clay loam type of soil texture)
	- best pore size distribution for water movement


#### Process
- 9% expansion in volume
- vertical flow of H20 to the freezing front
	- freezing of water lowers the matric potential
	- the area around the soil becomes more dry, because it moves up and becomes ice; reduces the water potential, creating a water potential gradient, which draws water up to the freezing front
- the process maintains a **temperature gradient**; otherwise if the gradient gets too strong ; then freezing in place
	- temperature gradient is maintained by using energy to convert water to ice (liquid to solid phase)
- if the air temperature us too low, the water will be frozen in place and not move up; best temperature is negative a few degrees; if temperature gradient is too great, the water freezes to lower that gradient
- coarse-textured, low susceptibility
	- because the water cannot easily move up - larger pore spaces - more air bubbles - disconnection of water to prevent it from moving up to freezing front
- fin-textured, low susceptibility
	- low because the water is well connected and can move to freezing front, however because the pore spaces are small, the water can only move very slowly; not enough water that can keep supplying the freezing front, so the amount of energy released from liquid to solid phase is not enough, so greater potential for water to freeze in place
- high silt soils intermediate in matric potential and permeability, high susceptibility


#### Beneficial aspects of freezing
- development of soil structure (if it has pore structure to begin with)
	- if it has good structure to begin with, it may damage the structure
	- it is relative
- increase in moisture in the upper horizons
- migration of soil animals to deeper horizons
	- helps formation of soil structure
	- movement in soil may reduce compaction of deeper soils
	- brings nutrients; release organic matter - become source of organic matter 
- delays initiation of growth in spring (some species vulnerable to late frosts)
- destruction of certain insects
- improves conditions for use of mechanization for timber harvesting


#### Detrimental effects
- interrupt the continuity of microbiological and chemical processes
- reduces soil evaporation losses - when soil is too wet, water below ice cannot be moved up and evaporate
	- may increase water table level making it too wet for planting or for the survival of plants; 
	- only in certain conditions - only if there is too much water
- decreases soil permeability
- can enhance conditions for physiological drought
	- above ground the plants may be responding to the temperature - e.g. transpiring; but below ground they cannot get water because of the ice - so they experience physiological drought
- causes soil to swell
	- detrimental to plants - like small plants (seedlings) especially
		- frost heaving occurring just a few centimetres below surface, ice grabs seedling and tries to push it up, and may break the root system  - leaving the part anchored deeper
		- may also push up and expose roots, not leaving much root system below in the soil
		- often plug planted 2-3 cm below surface so chances of it being pushed above soil is minimized - especially for sites susceptible for frost heaving
- may delay start of silvicultural operations


#### Control of Frost Heaving
- changing surface condition
	- slash cover on surface - to reduce surface soil temperature fluctuations
		- insulating layer prevents penetration of temperature to mineral surface
	- soil drainage (to cut water supply, lower water table)
		- bring water table below area where it can rise
	- scarification to reduce Db (bulk density)
		- increases pore space, try to disrupt water supply, water is less well-connected
	- Planting with top of seedling plug below surface by at least 2-3 cm
