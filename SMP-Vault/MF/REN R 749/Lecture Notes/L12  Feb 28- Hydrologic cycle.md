- streamflow, precipitation, evaporation, transpiration, interception (by vegetation and forest flow), Ws ( change in water storage), drainage to deeper layers(-)/discharge to the stream - contributing to streamflow(+)
- deficit = difference between potential evapotranspiration and actual evapotranspiration - how much is available
	- more vegetation - transpiration causes a greater water loss than evaporation, otherwise, it is evaporation



### Soil in the Water Cycle
`I = P - [Ci + Fi + (Rs + RSS)]
I = infiltration
Ci = canopy interception
Fi = forest floor interception
Rs = surface runoff (overland flow)
Rss = subsurface flow


## Factors affecting infiltration


Infiltration
-  Downward entry of water into soil 
-  Volume of water passing through soil per unit area per unit time
-  Infiltration rate of almost all forest soils with intact organic horizons (forest floor) > maximum rate of rainfall intensity

- infiltration: entry of water into the soil
	- usually more than precipitation is possible, so minimal runoff but not always
- percolation: downward movement of water within the soil in the saturated condition

- **Nature and thickness of organic horizons**
	- reducing the impact of raindrops and preventing sealing (puddling) and crusting of surface porosity
	- humus form: mull 2x > mor (two strata of different hydraulic characteristics)
		- mull: organic matter mixed with mineral soil to make organi-mineral compounds benefiting soil structure
	- Absorb water
	- Forest floor has to be > 1cm thickness to be effective
	- net effect: to increase percolation and hold runoff at minimum


- **soil texture** affecting infiltration
	- deep sands, silts 1-3+
	- sands >2
	- sandy loam 1-2
	- loam 0.5-1
	- clay loam 0.1-0.5
	- clay : 0.1-0.5
	- clay(swelling) < 0.1 - becomes slower as it swells
	- sodic clay < 0.1
		- salts and salinity - tends to disperse clay particles and prevent the formation of soil structure, so this makes infiltration very slow through micro pores in clay

- **Clay mineralogy** - presence of swelling clays, esp. Na-montmorillonite

- **soil structure**e -easily affected by forest management

- **soil temperature**

- **freezing** - ice formation

- **wettability of surface** / hydrophobicity/hydrophilicity -natural water repellency in coarse-textured soil by hydrophobic organic compounds and effects of fire
	- organic compounds mostly hydrophobic - repel water
	- problematic with coarse-textured soil because in coarse-textured soils thee is much less surface area for soil particles to be coated
		- fine-textured soils have a large surface area, up to 1000x different
	- distributing volatile organic compounds on a much smaller surface area with coarse-textured soil, so much easier to coat the entire surface area
	
- initial water content - if already high, less room for water to get into the soil

- rainfall intensity
	1. high rainfall intensity and poor surface protection - can destroy the soil structure, reducing the infiltration rate
	2. when intensity is much greater than infiltration rate, there will be runoff

- impeding layers, including water table proximity to surface
	- ice
	- water-table too close to surface, once it reaches the water table, nowhere to go
	- compact layer

- vegetation - generally increases infiltration rate
	- provides organic horizon
		- minimizes raindrops effects
	- indirect effect through litter production
	- soil structure -  root exudates, more soil structure
	- root channels

- soil fauna
	- pores - larger pores created by soil fauna
	- infiltration rate - to the fourth power of the pore size


### Factors affecting evaporation rate from undisturbed profiles (water loss from soils)
- energy available at soil surface (active surface) - e.g. solar energy
	- surface condition (cover) - insulates soil surface
- Rate of transport of soil water to soil surface - is there water available at the soil surface
	- pore geometry of organic horizons that determines Kunsat
		- usually have very large pore space
		- very pore for conducting water, especially in unsaturated conditions, matrix potential is high (does not facilitate movement of wwater)
	- e.g. if surface in capillary fringe = constant supply of water
		- if not, then it depends on the soil water content = unsaturated conditions
- if high energy, limited water - will heat up the soil, otherwise, the evaporation would cool down the soil surface


## Factors affecting evaporation rate from undisturbed profiles
- surface condition 
	1.  organic matter/litter covers forest floor vs. corn field having no cover
		1. in the corn field - does not have organic matter accumulate (cultivated annually) 
	2. corn field has no vegetation cover in the spring, very exposed in the spring, but as the plants grow, the transpiration rate increases and the evaporation rate decreases to be on par with forest
		1. in a forest, even in a deciduous forest, there will be other vegetation that may protect the soil from evaporation/radiation - so there will be some vegetation from both the large trees, non-dominant trees, and under-story vegetation


### Effects of Forest Management Practices
- manipulation of stand density to alter water use patterns
	- change the water balance
	- Methods:
		- remove vegetation - remove density of overstory trees and understory vegetation - as long as you are removing leaf area
			- will remove the transpiration, and may reduce water loss, and may increase streamflow
			- then go back to equation to see the effect
				- `I = P - [Ci + Fi + (Rs + RSS)]
- Removal of vegetation (including understory vegetation): increase in water yield (water moving out of watershed)
	- in northeastern watersheds in New Hampshire, developed an emperical relationship for forest ecosystems there to determine number of inches of water flowing out of watershed - related to reduction in basal area
		-` (X - reduction in BA) : Y (inches) = -1.39 + 0.13X %
		- BA = basal area
		- intercept is negative - if you remove less than 10 percent, you will actively decrease the yield, if more than 10% then you may be able to increase the yield - so probably remove about 20% of basal area to have a positive effect on the water yield
- Water table - may rise if you remove trees
	- in some cases if trees have direct access to water in the water table - water is moving to the main rooting zone through the capillary fringe
		- if you remove the trees, it could negatively impact the water table, where the water table is fairly high
			- trees would have provided transpiration of water out of the soil so without them, and without all their transpiration causing losses, the water table may move up.
			- could change the forest ecosystem from an otherwise upland ecosystem to a wetland
			
Thonthwaite method (simplified)
- P2 - if temp below zero, precipitation is snow
- PE - if below zero, evaporation is 0 or very low, increases substantially above 0
- P-PE - potential water deficit or surplus - is precipitation greater or less than evaporation
- ST - storage capacity per 1 m of soil (in mm H20
- deltaST
	- if added (e.g. snow on surface), it is positive; when melted it goes into soil as storage; or from water added to soil itself.
	- if negative (e.g. evaporation/warmer temperatures) 
- AE - Actual Evaporation
- D - deficit PE vs AE
- S - surplus PE vs AE - water being runoff from site
- surplus + P-PE makes up loss
- must account for what is melted on top for the P-PE deficit, if not enough snow, then it comes from the storage - which would be a deficit to meet the evaporation potential difference
