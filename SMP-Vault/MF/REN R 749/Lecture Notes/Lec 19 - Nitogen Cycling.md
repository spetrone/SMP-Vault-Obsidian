- N is a structural element of DNA and RNA
- N is a major part of all amino acids (proteins, enzymes)
- N is part of chlorophyll
- Nitrate leaching and denitrification (N2)) cause environmental problems
- 10mg/L / 10 ppm is limit for drinking 
	- high nitrate can cause cancer and blue baby syndrome
- N is usually the most limiting for forest productivity
- strong relationship between above ground primary production and the amount of nitrogen mineralization
	- stronger relationship with natural stand vs. managed stand
	- plantation is managed - depends on natural mineralization
	- natural stands - more likely to have fertilization
		- organic mineralization is less reliable
- more above ground biomass --> more nitrogen uptake
	- shows that nitrogen is the limitation


### The Nitrogen Cycle
- dominated (e.g 85%) by the biogeochemical and biochemical cycles
	- - will less pollution, less dry or less deposition, and less nitrogen
- nitrate 
- the soil contains 10-20 times as much N as does the vegetation (temp/boreal)
	- especially in boreal and temperature region only
	- in tropical regions - most nutrients are in the vegetation
- Most soil N is in the organic form
- Inorganic N is usually 1-2% of the total soil N
- pros and cons of nitrogen in organic/inorganic
	- inorganic is more subject to losses
		- ammonium converts to nitrate
			- then nitrate to dinitrogen or nitrogen oxide - so nitrogen is lost
	- downside in organic form
		- most plant species are not able to utilize them
			- some plant species can take up simple nitrogen forms such as small amino acids
				- e.g. some shrub species in the boreal forest where mineralization rate is very slow - mineralization is controlled by temperature / microbial activity
- N is severely affected by forest fires, particularly in the boreal forest
	- fire is frequent, fire return interval is ~100 years
	- causes the nitrogen even in the organic form accumulated in forest floor (where fast majority is in forest soils - rather than chernozemic)
		- if forest floor is burnt the nitrogen can be lost can be lost in a couple of hours or days

### Soil Solution N
- soil solution is the centre of nitrogen cycling - nitrogen  linked to many other components in the ecosystem
	- can be taken up, transformed, leached, denitrification
- all uptake is from the soil solution

### Carbon Nitrogen Connection 
- most nitrogen is in the organic form and if it is in organic form it is directly linked/associated with carbon in carbon-based molecules (organic molecules)
- need to break up carbon bonds to release organic nitrogen

![[Pasted image 20250321091555.png]]
### Decomposition Process / Mineralization Process
- generally the term decomposition refers to the decomposition of litter
- mineralization is more generally related to converting organic matter that is mostly decomposed 
- this is a ***microbial process*** - breaking down litter or mineralization
	- depends on:
		- environmental conditions
		- quality of the litter
	- affects: nitrogen availability in the system
- cannot consider nitrogen in isolation - directly linked with C in a C:N ratio

# Mineralization and Immobilization
1. Mineralization
	- any kind of organic molecule (nitrogen attached to a carbon chain) < -->ammonification process through hydrolysis to ammonium
	- then nitrification to NO2 (nitrite)
	- then further nitrification to NO3 (nitrate)
	- reverse: immobilization
- depends on the availability of oxygen -- pushes towards nitrate
- nitrite is toxic to plants and microbes
	- luckily the nitrite to nitrate conversion is very fast
	- the rate limiting step is from ammonium to nitrite
		- if the second step is inhibited for some reason, then you could have the accumulation of nitrite
#### Summary of mineralization:
- Ammonification: an enzymatic process of organic N hydrolysis 
- Nitrification: enzymatic oxidization of ammonium N by autotrophic bacteria, under aerobic conditions 
- **In forest soils, soil solution is dominated by NH4+** 
	- **this is because the low pH inhibits the nitrification process** -- reducees the nitrate concentration
	- lack of disturbance in the forest soils vs agricultural soils 
- Most forests produce <100 kg N/ha/yr through mineralization 
	- this is a very low number compared to agricultural soils - where that value could be double
	- trees require less nitrogen as annual crops
	- long-living plants don't need as much - so they are taking up a lot of nitrogen cumulatively
- Under anaerobic conditions NO3- can be reduced through denitrification

## Denitrification
four steps
1. nitrate to nitrite (reduction of the nitrate)
2. nitrite to nitric oxide
3. nitric oxide to nitrous oxide
4. nitrous oxide to dinitrogen gas

- mostly by facultative anaerobic bacteria such as Pseudomonas, Bacillus, etc.
- Anaerobic condition (soil air has < 10% O2)
	- the more anaerobic there will be more N2 again
	- intermediate anaerobic, more N2O (nitrous oxide) - less favorable to denitrification and worse for the environment
- pH <5 inhibits rapid denitrification and favors the formation of N2O
	- incomplete denitrification from low soil pH
	- greenhouse gas 

- some potential benefits and some damaging effects
	- damaging effect: release of nitrous oxide; long-lived greenhouse-gas
	- beneficial effect: 
		- usually we don't want denitrification but sometimes we do
		- want it in soils with excess nitrogen (more specifically nitrate) that could leach into water. Could be beneficial to remove some.
			- e.g. with pure alder stands
		- also in ***wastewater treatment*** to remove excess nitrogen

- Percent of water-filled pore space is closely related to nitrification, ammonification, and denitrification
	- more water-logged - more anaerobic (<10% oxygen) - more denitrification starts to occur


#### conditions favoring different nitrogen processes
![[Pasted image 20250321093901.png]]
 - 50% is best condition for plants
- also most favorable for nitrification rates
- ammonification is less affected by the availability of oxygen. There is still ammonification when 100% of pore space is water.
- % pore space filled with water is best measure/indicator of aeration


## N Management in Forest Soils

(a) To increase soil N availability
	- add lime to correct the soil pH
	- Prepare site mechanically to enhance S.O.M decomposition
		- enhances mineralization
		- every time there is mechanical disturbance: will increase mineralization
			- improves aeration 
			- expose some of the organic matter otherwise protected in aggregates -then can be attacked by microbes
	- Manipulate stand composition
		- e.g. including nitrogen-fixing species
		- or more species richness - think about niches
		- or include more deciduous trees that will produce litter of higher quality with lower C:N ratio
	- Use legumes to fix N
	- Fertilize forest sites with N fertilizers
		- more expensive
		- economic and environmental costs
			- the efficiency of the fertilization is very low (10-20% immobilization, most lost from the system)

(b) To control competition for soil N
- control weeds (especially establishment phase of plantations)
- thin stands to reduce inter- and intra-specific competitions
	- reduce density

(c) To increase plants' ability to use soil N
	- maintain tree health
	- maintain balanced nutrition
	- inoculate seedlings with mycorrhizas
	- maintain soil temperature
	
(d) To minimize soil N loss
- harvest the boles only
- do not burn or control burn intensity
- minimize soil displacement
- minimize soil disturbance - reduce soil erosion
- avoid soil compaction
- avoid water-logging conditions
- to match N supply with tree demand
