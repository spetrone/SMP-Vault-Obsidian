### **Applications:**
- off-road trafficability
- sewage disposal - septic fields
- Suitability of soils for road construction
	- e.g. logging road
- soil stability
	- largely related to soil sheer strength
		- how stable is a slope - the ability of the soil particles to resist movement


- soil bearing strength (ease of penetration) calculated with a penetrometer (pounds per square inch)
	- reading is resistance to pushing penetrometer into soil
	- ![[Pasted image 20250211235705.png |800]]
##### Soil texture and coarse fragment contents will strongly influence :

-  soil bearing strength and other trafficability parameters
	- depends on
		- water content
		- texture
		- coarse fragment - will increase the bearing strength of the soil

- cohesiveness and consistence
	- cohesiveness - how easily a soil can be broken apart (dry and wet) - how sticky
	- different testing in soil science and soil engineering
		- soil science fine earth fraction (<2mm)
		- engineering < 0.042mm
	
- frost heave susceptibility
	- ability of water to come up from deeper soil to create frost-heaving potential
		- builds and pushes up ice/ground surface
	- important for engineering/road building
	- alter texture and coarse fragments 

- water retention
	- from soil texture and its qualities
	- 
- Tillage characteritics
	- especially: 
		###### - compactability (related to pore space)
		- suitability to tillage after rain
			- if compactible/clayey, do not want to go after rain
	- get chart from slides


### Soil strength and sudden failure

### COHESION
- **cohesive soils** - clay more than 15%
	- the soil particle's ability to stick together
	- strengths of cohesive soils declines dramatically if very wet
		- reason - too much water it becomes a lubricant and the particles can more easily move -- therefore it loses strength
		- a few layers - forms bridges
		- too many layers - lubricant
- soil strength is caused by:
	- the inherent electrostatic attractive forces between clay particles and between clay surfaces and water in very fine pores.
	- the frictional resistance to movement of soil particles
	- size: easier for small particles to get really close together
- test strength : unconfined compression test - tests the shear strength
	- collect column of fresh (moist) soil in between two porous plates
		- must be porous because otherwise water would accumulate and affect the strength of the soil
	- dependent on moisture content - soil strength test result is specific to that moisture level

#### Noncohesive soils
- when dry, the strength depends entirely on frictional forces
	- a small amount of water bridges the gaps between particles and increases strength

##### Collapsible soils:
- certain soils lose their strength suddenly if they become wet
	- mostly of non-cohesive materials - the weak bridges of water breaking with more water
	- example : collapsible sand castles


##### Settlement - gradual compression
- most foundation problems result from slow, often uneven, vertical subsidence or settlement of the soil
	- often from an uneven distribution of water content in soil - creating different strengths in different areas
	-  Frost heaving - effects on settlement when in the summer some of it thaws - there is different water content, which confounds
	- Frost heaving in the winter expanding
- **Proctor test:** Proctor curve, showing:
	- maximum bulk density to which the soil may be compacted by a given force
		-  depends on soil moisture - higher moisture = higher bulk density = initially more compaction is possible; 
			- water binds particles together allowing compaction - sticking together
		- except with more water when water occupies all the pore space and you cannot compact water
	- optimum water content for maximum compaction
		- compressibility: 
		organic soils (peats) > clayey soils > sandy soils
		- sandy soils are hard to compact because of large particle sizes
	- put soil in container, and use drop hammer with specified force - measure how much the depth changed
	-
- soil must be compressible to have strength and to therefore withstand weight - roads
- for foundations, though, sandy soils are better because they resist compaction 


#renr749exam
- how to draw the curve - **draw /extrapolate the smooth curve** and determine the highest point
- to achieve *at least* 90% (or greater) of the maximum compaction  - what moisture content do you need?
	- anything between the two 90% (give the range of moisture content) 


### Sieve Analysis - Grain Size Evaluation
- determine particle size distribution
- *engineering definition - different from soil science
1. **Gravel (3")** - 76.2 mm
	1. Coarse gravels (> 19mm)
	2. fine gravels (< 19 mm))
2. **Sands** ( #4) - 4.76 mm
	1. #4 - per inch there are 4 openings
3. **Fines** (#200) - 0.074mm
	1. #200 - per inch there are 200  openings
	2. Fines = fine fraction
	3. in engineering - with lots of "fines" - not considered to be good materials for construction

- also important is #40 sieve (0.42mm) as it affects many engineering properties - such as consistency 
	- similar to #10 sieve in soil science - most testing is done under this

- intermediate sieves: used for creating a grain size distribution
	- in the chart - height of line shows amount of material left in sieve
	- #10  (2mm) is most common in *soil science* as that is the cutoff for sand as upper limit
	- see how much is retained on each sieve as percent

### Soil Consistency (soil engineering)
- a term usted by soil engineers to describe the degree to which a soil resists deformation when a force is applied,
- testing in engineering: determined by the soil's resistance to penetration by an object (penetrometer)
- testing in soil science: soil's resistance to fracture/rupture it 
- engineering: < 0.42 mm #40
- soil science : < 2mm #10


### Grain Size Chart and Parameters
D - diameter
- uses a semi-logarismic chart
- follow 60, 30, and 10 on the y axis(percent) and retrieve the value on the x axis (the diameter)
D60 : the diameter of the material from which point 60% of the soil is finer than
D30: the diameter of the material from which point 30% of the soil is finer than
D10: the diameter of the material from which point 10% of the soil is finer than

- used to determine how well-distributed a soil is
- to determine the size fraction - look for area under the curve 
	- right is smaller
	- left is larger
	- below B has more finer material
NOTE READ CAREFULLY if percent passing vs percent retained
- esp for calculating D60, D30, D10 

![[Pasted image 20250124095039.png]]

- D60, D30, D10 are the diameters (D) corresponding to 60, 30 and 10% FINER (passing) that D
- D60, D30, D10 will be used for classification of unified classes


## Attenberg Limits
- changes of behavior of soils
- Atterberg limits can help predict the behaviour of particular soils

![[Pasted image 20250127091229.png]]
1. **Shrinkage Limit (SL)**
	- from solid state to semisolid state
	- depends on water content (volume of water added)
	- soil volume might increase after transition from solid state
		- slope depends on minerology - e.g. clay minerals - expanding
	- –the gravimetric water content (%) at the threshold between “solid” and “semi-solid” consistency
2. **Plastic Limit (PL)**
	- from semisolid to plastic (moldable)
	- Determination: • The water content at which a 1/8”thread of soil can be rolled out but it begins to crack and cannot then be re-rolled
		- must have gone through the #40 sieve
		- compare weight measurements to determine water lost 
1. **Liquid Limit (LL)**
	- from plastic to liquid (soil will behave as a liquid)
	- determination: The water content at which a groove cut in a soil paste will close (by 1/2”) upon 25 repeated drops of a brass cup with a rubber base •
	- On soil finer than # 40 sieve
	- over 25 - too dry
	- under 25 - too wet

- the gravimetric water content at the threshold of solid and s
