- food/agricultural plants are often more sensitive to soil pH than tree species
	- agriculture production systems - lyming is much more commonly done
	- in forestry, trees not as sensitive, so for most scenarios, lyming is not a requirement; but if soil pH is fairly strongly acidic , not necessarily because the trees cannot handle the pH, but because the aluminum solubility increases and that harms plants; 
		- lyming in forests it mostly to reduce aluminum toxicity

- soil pH affects:
	- solubility of Al (which is toxic to many plants and organisms)
	- weathering of minerals
	- availability of nutrients
	- activity of organisms
	- formation and stability of aggregates
		- through activities of organisms, producing more humus
		- low pH lots of fungal hyphae == binding agent
		- high pH - lots of sodium, which has dispersing properties - and it will weaken stability of the aggregates
	- distribution of cations in the exchange complex
		- exchanges sites - more hydrogen at low pH, replacing other cations, such as Calcium and Magnesium - higher hydrogen percentage on exchange sites, lower base saturation exchange 
			- further decreasing to 4 - aluminum on the exchange sites - because aluminum solubility quickly increases and soil solution has a lot of aluminum, so based on the ratio law - it will reach an equilibrium 
- in general, close to neutral is optimal for most nutrients for nutrient availability, and for fungi and bacteria activity in the soil
	- note that fungi can handle much lower pH 's (acidic) whereas bacteria do better in neutral or alkaline pH
- Al and Fe can become dominant factors in the production of hydrogen in the soil, depending on the pH condition of the soil

### Processes that produce or consume hydrogen ions (H+) in soil systems
![[Pasted image 20250314092938.png]]
- sulfur in particular is a very strong acid- oxidation of elemental sulfur - elemental sulfur is often used as a sulfur fertilizer, but then a slow process of oxidation is needed for plant uptake, but in the same process hydrogen will be produced



### The role of al in soil acidity
- both Fe and Al involved in increasing soil acidity, but also in buffering soil acidity (so it does not actually get super super acidic)
- when pH is lower than 4.5 Al hydrolizes, under 4, Fe is
	- aluminum is hydrolized and produce hydrogen
	- can be hydrolized three times to produce 3 hydrogens
		- reversible, so a lot of Al will push reaction the other way to produce H+, but with a lot of H+, will push the reaction towards the left side, to reach equilibrium
- oxidized form of Fe also carries 3 charges and also hydrolysis, but only in soils with pH < 4
- reversal of reactions is therefore a buffering mechanism

- Al3+ + H2) <---> AlOH2+ + H+
- AlOH2+  + H20 <--> Al(OH)2  + H+


### Pools of soil acidity
- active acidity ; H+ and Al3+ ions in the soil solution
- salt-replaceable (exchangeable) acidity: much greater than the active acidity and related to CEC
	- will be lower than just using water
	- hundreds of times greater than exchangeable acidity
- residual acidity: which can be neutralized by alkaline materials, caused by H+ and Al3+ ions bound in non-exchangeable forms by OM and clays - much greater than exchangeable acidity
	- thousands of times greater than active acidity
	- released if decomposed, exposing hydrogen to be dissociated
	- release from weather of the minerals they are adsorbed to
- Total = active + exchangeable + residual

## Buffering of pH in soils: mechanisms
- buffering - preventing soil pH from changing; functions of buffering capacity:
	- prevents from coming too acidic or alkaline
	- affects the amount of liming material to be added to the system to change the soil pH
- Al hydrolysis - which directions reactions are driven
	- very strong buffering capacity
	- once aluminum hydrolysis kicks in - much more difficult for pH to further drop
- organic matter reactions
	- whether organic matter is losing hydrogen from organic compounds, or if organic compounds are taking up hydrogen
- pH dependent charge sites on clay or on organic matter surfaces
- cation exchange
- carbonate dissolution and precipitation - either giving up or taking  up hydrogen

- pH by depth changes over time - soil changes more drastically closer to surface
	- initially quick reduction, then the reduction slows down
	- reduction in the deeper soil is much less dramatic, because acidity does not travel that farm (like past 75cm)
	- mostly from deposition



## Liming
- amount of lie or other bases required to neutralize the total acidity to a desired acidity level
- higher CEC == more liming material needed
- very very difficult to counteract residual acidity; 
	- neutralizes active and exchangeable acidity pools (short term)
	- requires long term liming to neutralize residual acidity - as it will continue to go down after liming and require more liming repeatedly
- agricultural liming materials (bases - very soluble):
	- CaC03 - limestone, calcite
	- MgCO3
	- CaMg(CO3)2 - dolomite limestone
	- CAO
	- MgO
	- wood ash - mostly various mg and ca oxides
		- highly soluble and effective lime material
	- CaMg(CO3)2 + 2H2) + 2CO2 <--> Ca2+ + 2HCO3 + Mg2+ + 2HCO3-
		- acidity dissolves the limestone and it releases the bases - carbonate ions
		- initially low solubility, breaks down into highly soluble bicarbonate ions (alkaline ions) that react with water to change back to carbonic acid acid  and release hydroxy ions, increasing the pH
			- Ca and Mg will exchange with H+ which will make carbonic acid and further raise the pH
	- lime requirement - how to determine:
		- change required in pH or exchangeable Al saturation
		- buffer capacity of the soil
		- chemical composition of the liming material
			- e.g. is it limestone (slower), MgO (faster), wood ash, etc.
		- fineness of the liming material
			- particularly with limestone and dolomitic limestone as those materials are slowly soluble, so the finer the limestone, the more effective they are
			- for all of them though, the finer, the more surface area, and therefore the faster they react with water
		- most effective:
			- fine material initially and re-apply rather than just slow release
			- or if all slow-release, must add a lot more to get an initial reaction right away


- CaO and MgO - most reactive and therefore more effective but very difficult and corrosive to handle

	- Example (for ACTIVE ACIDITY ONLY):
		- loam soil, inital pH 5 (50% base saturation), CEC 10 cmol/kg. To raise pH to 6.8 (90%) in the 0-15 cm
		- how much dolomitic limestone with CaCO3 equivalent of 90. Assuming BD 1.3 Mg/m^3


![[Pasted image 20250317151610.png]]
BS = "Base Saturation" - how much of the exchange sites are occupied by base cations (Ca2+, Mg2+) rather than acidic cations (H+, Al3+)

cmol == centimol == measure of charge
CEC : 10 cmol/kg

- take CEC, and multiply by percentage change charge sites - then get value in cmol/kg
- then convert the cmol/kg to the liming material g/kg, doing unit converstions (e.g. mol to cmol) as needed
- but then need to convert units of calcium to calcium carbonate - based on molecular weights of the calcium carbonate and the calcium
- then convert to per hectare 
	- surface area x depth x bulk density gives us the soil MASS;
	- then convert gram to kilogram
- then there is a purity conversion because the limestone is not pure, so divide by percent purity (e.g. of 90% pure, multiple by 100/90 or divide by 0.9)


Common amounts:

### Lime Application in Forests
- generally not practiced: accessibility problems (for ground-based spreaders)
	- also most trees fairly tolerant to low soil pH
	- difficulties in application: accessibility; ground-based methods are costly
- Aerial spreading (e.g. using helicopters) - more economical, but requires a suitable terrain for application
	- if a fixed-wing aircraft could be used, it would be even more economical, but only works in mild terrain
- Liming more common in Germany
	- industrialization caused a lot of acid deposition in large amounts
	- also in Eastern Canada and NE USA - now has treaties to reduce acid deposition
- Acid rain is the main concern for liming in forestry - Ca (also Mg and K) deficiency
	- but also:
		- elemental sulfur released to soil which gets oxidizes and produces acidity
	- when acidic, calcium is leached, so there is a calcium deficiency over time
- A Ca/Al ratio of 1 or less is considered a threshold for Al toxicity, **root growth inhibition, reduced Ca uptake and reduced survival of forest vegetation**
	- the leaching and deficiency of Ca in soil can contribute to this
	- if the ratio is greater than 2, there is very little risk for aluminum toxicity to occur
	- root cannot function properly


## Lowering soil pH
- often beneficial to high salt soils to add organic matter
	- improves pH, soil structure, drainage rate, percolation, infiltration,
- some soils have high alkalinity and need the soil pH to be neutralizes by adding:
	- acid organic matter (any organic matter is acidic)
	- inorganic chemicals such as Al2(SO4)3 or ferrous sulphate (FeSO4)
		- Fe2+ + 2H20 <-> Fe(OH)2 + 2H+
		- hydrolize to produce acidity (H+ ions) to lower soil pH
	- elemental S
	- sulphuric acid in some irrigation systems; sometimes in horticulture systems
