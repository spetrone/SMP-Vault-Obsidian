Cations exchanges
- reversible electrostatic sorption - maintains nutrients in soil
	- cation is held tight enough that it is not leached, but it is loose enough that it can be replaced
	- Micelle - Na+ + H+ <-> Micelle H+ + Na+
- At the exchange sites, the ions are held tightly engh by the soil colloids to greatly reduce their loss in drainage waters, but loosely enough to allow plant roots access to nutrients
- Two types of positive soil charges
	- permanent changes - caused by isomorphic substitution
	- pH dependent charges - whether positive or negative depends on pH
		- Protonation: the attachment of H+ ions t the surface OH- groups, causing net positive charges
		- as pH increases, becomes deprotonated, and even H+ can be de-protonated, giving it a negative charge
		- e.g. `al-OH + H+ <-> Al-OH+`
- Adsorption of cations and anions
	- dependent on the number of charges carried by those cations or anions
	- dependent on the size of the ions
	- Cations: Al3+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ = NH+ > Na+
	- Anions: HPO2- >> SO42- > NO3- >= Cl-
	- most soils have net negative charge on particle surfaces, so have generally low AEC and higher CEC
	- the higher the charge and the smaller the hydrated radius of the cations, the more strongly it will adsorb to the colloid
	
- Two different types of colloid-ion complexes:
	- **Outer-sphere comple**x: water molecules form a bridge between the adsorbed ion and the charged colloid surface
		- water molecules surround (hydrate) the cations and anions in the soil solution - this weakens adsorption to colloids
		- ions in the outer-sphere complex are easily replaced by other similar charged ion
	- Inter-sphere complex: adsorption does not involve any intervening water molecule (inner sphere???)
		- this type of adsorption involves relatively strong bonds
	
### Principles governing cation exchange reactions:
- 1. **reversibility:** a fundamental principle - cation exchange is reversible
- 2. **charge equivalence:** cation exchange takes place on a charge-for-charge basis
- 3. **Ratio law:** at equilibrium, cation ratios are the same in the solution, on the exchange sites, and in the whole soil
	- the percent saturation (cation ratios) of a particular ion as that saturation on the exchange site == equilibrium - when cation exchange is complete

- 4. **Anion effects on mass action:** an exchange reaction will be more likely to proceed to the right if the released ion is prevented from reacting in the reverse direction

- **5. Cation selectivity** : some cations are held much more tightly than others
	- will still reach equilibrium based on concentrations - this is more related to short-term changes
	- the order of strength of adsorption of most common cations
		`Al3+ > Ca2+ > Mg2+ > K+ = NH4+ > Na+
	- strength of most common anions:
	` HPO42- >= SO42- > NO3- >= Cl-
	
- **6. complementary cations:** neighboring cations
	- affects which may be exchanged - if all others are harder, easier one will be more likely; if all others are way easier, then less likely to be exchanged
		- e.g. if all others bigger - bigger ones are less strong and easier to exchange so if one K+ and all others are Na+, Na+ is larger and those will be more likely to be exchanged
	- e.g. when roots exude H ions to exchange with cations on the colloid
		- within the plant itself - it is charged neutral - with the soil solution
	- tropical soil vs. boreal soil - there is a lot more Aluminum and pH lower because much more oxidixed
		- therefore compared to boreal soil, for the same amount of potassium, the potassium will be more available because the aluminum is harder to exchange, and potassium will be selectively preferred from cation exchange sites surrounded by Aluminum, 

#### Cation exchange and nutrient availability
1. By cation exchange, hydrogen ions from the root hairs and microorganisms replace nutrient cations from the exchange complex
	- release H+ to maintain charge balance in soil solution as well as in the plant
	- as a mechanism for maintaining cation availability in the soil
	- released H+ may cause soil acidification
2. If the % saturation of cation is high (and everything else the same), the displacement of that cation is comparatively easy and rapid - high availability; even if total amount is less; 
	-  Influence of complementary cations: K+ or (NH4)+ is more likely to be replaced off the colloid if the complementary ions are mainly tightly-held Al3+ (as in TROPICAL region)
3. Effect of type of colloid (soil mineralogy): at a given % base-saturation, smectites - which have a high charge density per unit of colloid surface - held cations more strongly than does kaolinite (low charge density)
	1. less weathering when charge density is high - it holds onto the nutrients
	2. 1:1 clays more common in tropical regions - less CEC, highly weathered, weathers more easily


- in Boreal soils there is abundance Ca+, Mg+, but in tropical soil, most have been lost from weathering; Ca2+ from minerals easily replaces that uptake from plant.
	- tropical soils, million of years old
	- boreal sois 10,000 years old

- Why more difficult to restore soil productivity after logging in a tropicla rainforest in Oxisols vs the luvisols in boreal (mostly related to CEC) 
	- al at exchange sites - therefore new nutrients will be leached
	- main factor: **in boreal the CEC is so much higher ; very low CEC in tropical forests; in boreal most nutrients are contained int the soil**
		- one type of clay mineral in tropical soils: mostly 1:1 kaolinite and Al, Fe Oxides
			- more leaching, because they hold charges less
	- most nutrients are held in the plants rather than in the soil, so when harvested, much harder to replace nutrients
