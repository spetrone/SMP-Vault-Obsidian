**Well graded soil:** with many particle size classes well presented
# Unified Classification System

**D60** : the diameter of the material from which point 60% of the soil is finer than
**D30**: the diameter of the material from which point 30% of the soil is finer than
**D10:** the diameter of the material from which point 10% of the soil is finer than

- **Shrinkage Limit (SL)** :  from solid state to semisolid state
- **Plastic Limit** (PL) : From semisolid to plastic
	- determination - water content when rolling 1/8" thread of soil that can be rolled but it begins to crack and then cannot be re-rolled
- **Liquid Limit** (LL) : from plastic to liquid
	- determination: The water content at which a groove cut in a soil paste will close (by 1/2”) upon 25 repeated drops of a brass cup with a rubber base ; over 25 - too dry; under 25 - too wet
	- on soil finer than # 40 sieve

- **Plastic Index (PI)** = Liquid Limit - Plastic Limit
	- PI <7 ***slightly***,
	- PI 7-17 ***medium***,
	- PI >17 ***highly plastic***

- large ratio of PI to LL (PI < 25) : many clayey soils
	 - below A-line: non-plastic
	- Above A-line: plastic (high clay content)

### Layers
- **Surface** - a water-shedding layer with high shear strength. GW-GC intergrade ideal 
- **Base** - the main load-spreading layer 
- **Sub-base** - (sometimes omitted) resists erosion, resists “pumping” - ejection of material by water through joints or cracks by deflection of slab under passing loads, facilitates drainage, insulates against frost penetration, and breaks capillary water columns 
- **Subgrade** - the foundation or supporting soil for a road or airfield


# Compressibility
**compressibility**: maximum bulk density to which the soil may be compacted by a given force; there is an optimum water content.
- organic soils (peats) > clayey soils > sandy soils
- Proctor test:

# Soil Bearing Strength & Trafficability

## California Bearing Ratio (CBR)
`CBR = (test load)/(standard load) x 100`
 \> 60 = high bearing strength
 < 40 = low bearing strength

### Trafficability - penetrometer test
- trafficability estimates for military vehicles
- RCI = rating cone index
- CI = cone index with a cone penetrometer
- RI = remolding index, ratio of remolded soil strength to original strength
- `RCI = CI x RI`

## Soil Carrying Capacity
### Percolation Test
- maximum rate permitted for septic tank drain field: 25 min/cm
- minimum depth to a water table or bedrock or other drainage restrictions: 1.2m
- distance to open water: > 30 m
- avoid sites with extremely rapid percolation
