##### SPAC - Soil Plant Atmospheric Continuum
- key thing to remember: water moving around the system is in response to the water energy level / water potential
	- following water potential gradient
	- high water content/potential to lower content/potential
- soil typically around -50 kPa
- potential at roots, typically around -70 kPA
- tree crown - around -85kPa
- leaves - around -500kPa
	- draws water up xylem
	- difference between crown and leaves - the force applied will be very high - demand for water flow to leaf surface where potential is 10 lower
- atmosphere - 40x lower : -20,000 kPa
	- demand to draw water into atmosphere
		- evapotranspiration
	
- as moisture accumulates in atmosphere, meets cold temperature, RH decreases - moisture comes down as precipitation
## Three types of water movement types
1. Saturated flow
	1. movement under conditions all pores filled with water and matric potential is near 0
	2. water moves in large pores in response to gravitational potential
	3. may have standing water on the soil surface
	4. Described by Darcy's Law #RENR749exam 
	- propotional to hydraulic conductivity and hydraulic gradient

	`Q = L deltaH/L`

```
Q: flow volume
k = saturated hydrualic conductivity
deltaH/L = hydraulic gradient
A - cross sectional area
t = time
```

- describes flow through a cross-sectional area for a given amount of time
	- coarse = higher
		- - higher than 1.8 cm/s == higher drainage
	- expansive clay - very low
		- 0.36  micrometre/hour
	- for **septic tank** < 2.5 cm/hr

- k (saturaded hydraulic conductivity) - dependent on soil texture

Factors affecting K 
-  Soil texture 
- Soil structure. 
	- Cracks, faunal (worm) holes and decayed root channels have tremendous effects. 
	- Total flow rate ∝ r 4 
	- **Contribution to preferential flow and K values:** K not constant in many soils: e.g.
		- solute concentration changes
		- dispersion of particles
		- swelling-shrinkage
			- swelling - fills pore space
				- lowers K
				- slows water movement
		- particle migration
		- air entrapment to block pore passages
		- temperature changes
			- water density and subsequent flow rate
				- most dense at 4C = sllowest

SUMMARY of Factors affecting clay
**• K = function of  (soil attributes, fluid attributes)** 
-  Soil attributes (pore geometry):
	- total porosity
	- pore size distribution,
	- Tortuosity: average ratio of the actual path to the straight flow path 
		- how windy of a path from point A to point B
		- more windy == higher tortuosity, straighter = lower tortuosity
		- ![[Pasted image 20250226165017.png]]
		-
	-
- Fluid attributes: 
	- density
	- viscosity

1. Unsaturated flow - the main way water moves around in the soil
2. Vapor Flow - the least important way water moves, and is the most slow
	1. from vapour pressure difference
		1. moves from high vapour pressure to low vapour pressure
		2. very minor
	2. only in very dry soils - soils near permanent wilting point

unless you have wetland or high water table, not usually saturated flow


### Factors Affecting K (Saturated hydraulic conductivity)
- texture
- disturbance - natural forest soil has highest - no management; vs agriculture - lots of distrubance
- tillage / management
	- tillage only slightly better in sandy soil (hard to compact sand); other soils (loam, clay loam), tillage reduces K - tillage causes compaction from the heavy machinery


### Preferential Flow
- water prefers larger pathways and macropores - therefore pollution movement can be very fast through these cracks
	- better for pollutants to percolate slowly through the soil - to be broken down by bacteria and fungi
	- preferential flow skips this
- e.g. most pollutant might leach in the first storm in the spring
	- first storm - any cracks available for water to go through; but after the first storm, they may lose those cracks, or they may have already been filled by water


### Unsaturated Flow
![[Pasted image 20250228091122.png]]

- Richard's law - quantity of the water flux in a cross sectional area
- quantity of the water flux; proportional to unsaturated hydraulic conductivity and water potential gradient
- slightly different than Darcy's law
- only difference - hydraulic conductivity is not constant - it will change with the water content, so the notation is slightly different ()
- water movement in response to gradient in ψt, mainly ψm; but could also be atmospheric, osmotic pressure/potential
- the prevailing condition in rapidly to imperfectly drained soil in sub-humid climates, upland soils - not usually saturated so usually it is unsaturated flow
- affected by water content and the size and continuity of the pores 
	- e.g. near saturation, sand > clay
	- as water content  theta) decreases, kunsat decreases at a faster rate in sand
		- because in clay soil, at lower water content below field capacity - there is better connectivity in the soil - in sand pore space has drained - disconnected
		- prior to this, faster in sandy soils
		- the point where this changes (from sand faster to sand slower) is generally considered to be at the field capacity
- large pore spaces emptied first



### Difference between saturated and unsaturaed
- as soil becomes unsaturated, some pores have air
	- large pores empty first
- tortuosity and viscosity increase at low matric potential
	- viscosity becomes higher because of the attraction to water molecules by soil particles / matrix at lower matric potentials / drier soils
- kunsant decreases by *several orders of magnitude* as matric potential goes from 0 to -100kPa
- kunsat opposite of ksat with regards to the ranking of textures
- sand vs clay loam
	- clay has greater matric potential that can pull it it multiple directions
	- downward movement more impeded in clay soils, which slightly pushes water to the sides as well


### Plant water uptake
- tree roots get their water from the pore space - from the larger pore space first
	- when used up, they will have to access water that is more tightly held
- two mechanisms for water to be supplied to the roots
	- moving up through capillary rise through the deeper soil
	- water movement in response to soil water potential
	- growth of roots into moist soil - root foraging (for water, also do it for nutrients)
	- hydraulic redistribution - deep rooting perennial plants such as alfalfa and trees: water from subsoil horizons
- the capillary movement ( a few cm a day) of soil water to plant roots, affected by:
		- capillary fringe
		- damage to root development by large seasonal fluctuation in depth to water table

#### Management implications
- soil root contact resistance for water flow
- large pores at the root-soil contact - large contact resistance -> not beneficial for plants to take up water
	- e.g. non packed soil when seedlings planted - too much root-soil contact resistance
- care in planting to reduce contact resistance
- maintaining large root/shoot ratios
	- important to deep water trees, otherwise it encourages root growth near soil surface but you want them to grow roots deep in the soil - then you have a lower root/shoot ratio
		- if you stop watering and there is a bad drought - trees could be killed easily
- a well ramified, well-distributed root system and well-developed mycorrhizae - all very good
