- mostly covered in REN R 210
- now specific to tree growth and forest productivity

### Physical properties overview:
1. Texture
2. Structure
3. Porosity
4. Stoniness
	-  influence soil's ability to provide nutrients
	-  affect rooting volume (reduced by coarse stones) - less space available for rooting
	-  less important than in agricultural soils because agricultural crops need more rooting volume for higher nutrient needs.
5. Depth - very important in forestry - more important than stoniness. 
	
6. Colour
- organic matter content
- leaching 
- wetness / water availability
- albedo at surface - darker absorb more light, might warm up soil faster but not always because the darkness might be influence by water content - absorb more energy but higher water makes heat capacity higher (needs more heat to heat up same volume of soil)


- all going to have an indirect effect on plant/tree growth (not directly though)


### Physical properties with direct effect on tree growth:
1. Soil moisture regimes
	- water available for tree growth
	- more not better (if waterlogged)
2.  Aeration
	- supply of O2
3.  Temperature
	- effect on metabolic activities in the soil and in the plant

### Interactions
*don't consider physical properties in isolation*
- soil chemistry
- organic matter dynamics
- soil biota


## Alterations
*soil physical properties are typically much more difficult to change compared to chemical properties*
- plowing
	- changes structural development
	- loosen soil
- soil compaction
	- one of the worse impacts for tree growth - must minimize in forestry operations
	- opposite effect of plowing
	- very negative impact on soil physical properties
	- negative impact on forest soils and tree growth
		- less water infiltration
			- - more surface run-off -more erosion is likely 
		- soil strength increased - more difficult root penetration
		- fewer macro pores; more dense
			- slow down water movement
			- decrease aeration - more likely to have anaerobic conditions even if less water can infiltrate and flow in soil
			- higher ratio of water - which will increase the heat capacity
		- lower microbial activity
		- less nutrients
		- more contact between soil particles - increase rate of heat transfer downwards; combined with higher heat capacity from a higher water ratio (from higher density) means that overall soil temperatures will be lower
	
*usually changed for the worse*

## SOIL 3 Phases
1. Solid phase (minerals and organic matter): 50% by volume is ideal ; 50% pore space
2. Liquid Phase - 50% of pore space (25% total phase) is ideal
3. Gaseous Phase - 50% of pores space (25% total phase) is ideal


## SOIL TEXTURE
three broad textural classes:
<2mm - fine earth fraction
> 2mm - coarse fraction - does not provide much to growth/nutrients
- Sands >0.05 mm 
	-  Very coarse sand 2.0-1.0 mm 
	- Coarse sand 1.0-0.5 mm 
	- Medium sand 0.5-0.25 mm 
	- Fine sand 0.25-0.10 mm 
	- Very find sand 0.10-0.05 mm 
- Silts 0.002-0.05 mm 
- Clays <0.002 mm

Tests:
thumb test; 
- mix with water and see how long it takes to settle
	- take liquid at certain depth, then dry it and see how much particles - repeat and see how it reduces
- greatest influence --> Surface area


## Soil Structure
- moderates the effects of soil texture through aggregation

- structureless
- massive
- spheroidal - fertile; good for plants; 
	- loam is best
	- must have some clay to bind particles together
	- in surface - indication of fertility
- easy to till;
- plate-like
	- most common in Ae horizon
		- as a result of horizontal loss of soil material prior to eluviation
- block-like
	- indication of heavy clay
	- most common in Luvisolic B horizons or Podzolic B horizons
- prism-like
	- common in saline soils in the B horizon
	- influenced by higher clay content

## Aggregation formation and stability
- Adsorbed cations: Na++ vs Ca2+
	- two main factors between these two cations:
	1. size of ions (sodium is much larger) will hydrate - react with water - water molecules will surround it - making it even bigger
		1. Ca2+ even smaller, does not hydrate as easily
	2. number of charges
		1. Na+ - one pos charge
			1.  Na+ can only bind to one clay particle - cannot bind with another sub-nuclear particle
			2. cannot bind clay particles together == UNSTABLE
		2. Ca - 2+ - can form a bridge between two clay particles - one with each charge 
			- more stable aggregates
- wetting and drying cycles
	- wet - swell - expand - weaken connections between particles
	- dry - contract - condense particles

- freezing/thawing
	- freezing - takes water away from soil particles and aggregates, shrinking soil, forming ice
	- the ice will expand which will condense and push soil particles together even more
	- thawing - re-expand, re-wet
	- repeated - influences soils structure

	- whether they increase or decrease / benefit or degrade structure  is relative depends on:
		- initial state
		- timing

- organisms on aggregation and stability
	- earthworms, roots, fungal hypae, micro-organisms release suarlike polysaccharides --> binding agent to bind particles together
	- fine roots and root hair - release mucilage, root exudates, polysaccharides --> binding agents
	- roots die/turnover + translocated lead litter --> become organic matter --> release binding compounds

### Soil Porosity
- **particle density:** usually **~2.65 g/cm3**
	- depends on minerology 
- **bulk density** - how much solid material in unit volume of soil
	- depends on texture and organic matter content
	- organic matter content will increase structure/aggregation, influence pore space/size and therefore bulk density
	
	`bulk density/particle density = % volume of solids
	- inverse is porosity see below
	
100- that number is the % volume of pores

Porosity:
`1 - (bulk density/particle density) * 100 


##### Pore Size:
- Macropores > 0.03mm
	- best for O2
- Mesopores 0.002 - 0.03mm
	- really good for holding water
	- indicates water availability to plants
- Micropores <0.002mm
	- water is held too tightly to soil particles, not available to plant uptake

*Pore size distribution informs soil's ability to provide water and O2*



## Example:

**Which soil has more total pore space, a sandy soil or a clayey soil?**
- clay soil will have more total pore space
	- in the clay soil there is a lot more micro pore and meso pore space
- higher bulk density - the sand will have less pore space
- lower bulk density - clay will have lower bulk density because of more pore space
- more compactable
	- clay more- more pores to compact
		- more variable distribution of particle sizes
	- sand - large uniform sand particles cannot be re-arranged as easily


which soil material has greater **particle density**, organo-mineral complexes or clay minerals?
	- do not count pore space
	- organic matter will reduce particle density so organo-mineral complex will have lower particle density
	- organic matter is light


Two different harvesting methods are being tested on adjacent forest plots with clay loam surface soil. Initially the BD was 1.1 Mg/m3. One year after harvest operations, BD in plot A was 1.48 Mg/m3, while in plot B it was 1.29 Mg/m3.

```
A: 1.1 Mg/m3 --> 1.48 Mg/m3  (change 0.38)
B: 1.1 Mg/m3 --> 1.29 Mg/m3 (change 0.19)
```

Interpret these values with regard to the relative merits of systems A and B, and the likely effects on the soilâ€™s function in the forest ecosystem?

B is better - less soil compaction

how do we achieve that?
- horse logging
- timing - frozen soil harvesting
	- don't go when wet
- selective harvesting
- tractors with large tires

effect on soil function:
- like to **soil compaction** - most important
- e.g. O2
- root penetration / strength
- water infiltration
- water content / waterlogging
- anaerobic conditions
