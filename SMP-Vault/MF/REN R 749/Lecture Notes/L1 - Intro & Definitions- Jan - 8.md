## Uses of Soils in  Forestry Industry 

### Slope Stability - road construction
- strength
- friction/resistance

### Locate Hiking 
- soil strength
- drainage classes - good drainage

## Forest Soils Definitions
- most common Luvisolic soil
- creation of a Bt horizon (transolcation of clay from A horizon)

#### (1) Any soil that has developed under the influence of a forest cover (broad definition)

- effects of deep rooting of trees
	- hydrology of the soil 
	 translocation of material in soil profile
- the role of organisms associated with forest vegetation
	- stronger acidity - mostly fungal associations
		- fungi not as effective at decomposition as bacteria
	- bacteria less resistant to soil
- the litter layer and eluviation promoted by the products of its decomposition
	- litter layer accumulates in forest soils --> promotes production of organic acid which will destabilize the clay in the soil, so there is more clay movement in the soil
	- chemical weathering may be accelerated in surface soil if there is high acidity
		- Iron and AL oxides leached out of surface soil -->enhances the eluviation from surface horizons

- indications agricultural soil was converted from forest site:
	- surface soil has changed
	- deep soil has not changed (more clay)

#### (2) Soils that are presently influenced by a forest cover (narrower definition)
- accumulation of organic matter on surface
- type of surface horizon is determined by the climate 
	- much thicker organic horizons in the boreal region (colder regions)
		- reason: low temperature, decreases the rate of decomposition, even though the rate of the litter return is lower than in a tropical forest
		- will produce acids
	- tropical regions --> acidic throughout horizons
		- humid and hot - entire soil profile is influenced --> more depth and degree of chemical weathering
	- boreal region --> acidic at surface horizons but down below the pH can be quite size, because the development of the soil is quite slow and the surface is more affected. Down below, more affected by geologic material. Many basic cations (Ca+)

Cause of iron layer (A horizon)
- organic acids from surface - intermediate products from decomposition
- eluviation of clay

both images:
- loss of clay from surface horizon
- Ae horizon - eluviated  - often white, but might just have a change in texture - less clay content, coarser texture
difference: the Ae horizon is not white in right image



- Alpac converting agricultural land to poplar plantations
	- soil will not be consistent with normal/natural forest soil development - especially non-disturbed and old-growth forests
	- 25 year rotation down from 80 to 100 years
	- in some locations even shorter rotations (5-6 year rotation) - Washington 
	- very intensive management - weed control until there is enough shade
	- organic horizons - 2/6 years using mechanical cultivation and then only 4 years for litter - is this a forest soil? - yes, based on second definition (under forest cover), but unlikely to see the horizons from definition (1) 
	- in between agricultural soil and forest soil
	- Influence from forest vegetation: 
		- 3-4 years of litter accumulation --> acidity 
		- deep rooting (deeper than annual crops)


narrow definition: 
- might miss soils that are altered but really are a forest soil
- does not classify soils altered from natural state, e.g. from agriculture which might alter the surface horizons to have less litter and OM than a natural forest soil

broad definition
- will account for long term effects of past forest cover
- might miss the more recent changes and current state of a soil that differ from natural forest soils 
	- e.g. heavily tilled or managed soil
	- less litter accumulation
	- different nutrient cycling


### Forest vs Agricultural Soils
- productive forest soils often poor for agronomic uses; forest soils are unique ; or sites not suitable for agriculture may be suitable for forests: 
	- poor drainage
	- steep slopes
	- presence of large stones, reduced rooting volume, water-holding capacity, reduced fine fractions - nutrient holding, CEC, etc. --> agricultural crops need this more, does not affect trees as much (***on an annual basis trees require much less nutrients***)
- Forest soils differ in that they:
	- have a litter layer/forest floor layer - entire organic horizons on top of mineral soils (called "floor")
		- affects appearance, nutrient cycling, decomposition
		- when cultivate/mixed in to mineral soils - decomposition is faster - much better contact with minerals with more microbial organisms; 
			- both good and bad  - less carbon sequestration/lower organic matter content stays in soil; carbon stock will be lower compared to adjacent forest soils. 
	- more uniform/stable moisture and temperature conditions
		- tree and vegetation cover minimizes direct sunlight reaching soil surface = less fluctuations in heating/cooling soil
		- allows more diverse microflora and fauna to live/develop + lack of disturbance (as forest soils are not cultivates as agricultural soils are)
	- more diverse microflora and fauna
	- deep soil horizons
	- usually natural bodies - generally not regularly disturbed anthropogenically (by human activities) as cultivates soils are
