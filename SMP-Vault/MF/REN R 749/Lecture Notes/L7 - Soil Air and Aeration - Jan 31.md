  - central maxim of ecology: everything is connected to everything else
	- the three phases in soil - any changes will change the distribution of other phases
- objective in forest management: to maintain a high level of oxygen in the soil for root respiration


### 3 Principal factors regulating soil aeration
1. **Soil texture** - macroporosity - as affected by texture and structure
2. **High soil water content**
	- reduces pore space for air storage
	- impedes air movement
	- initially mostly in micro and meso pore space but then with more water in macro pore space as well
	- O2 can diffuse through water but it is very slow
3. **O2 consumption by respiring organisms**


why does oxygen level not get affected as much near surface after rainfall?
- mostly because oxygen can diffuse more quickly at surface - rapid due to proximity
- water percolates to deeper layers

## 2 Mechanisms for soil gas exchange

1. **Mass flow** - esp. near surface
	- mass movement of air
	- affected by:
		- fluctuations in soil moisture content
		- heating and cooling of the soil
			- warm - air expands
			- cool - air shrinks, draws in air
		- wind
		- changes in barometric pressure

1. **Diffusion** - across a partial pressure gradient of gases
	- Main mechanisms for air exchange (more than with mass flow)
		- especially in deep soil
	- diffusivity of O2 in air 10^4 times > water
	- temperature - more diffusion when warmer


## Characterization of Soil Aeration
- concentration of O2 and other gases in the soil atmosphere - most direct measurement
	- Atmosphere : 21% O2, 0.0422% CO2, 78% N2
	- Is is **anaerobic** - < **10%** O2?
	- changing?

- Air-filled soil porosity
	- ideal condition is 50%, 25% and 25% solid, air and water

- chemical redox potential (oxidation-reduction)
	- Based on tendency for hydrogen to lose an electron - that potential is used as a reference - set at 0 (Eh is redox potential)
		- use electrodes to measure the redox potential in the soil air to see what the tendency in the soil atmosphere to lose an electron
			- 2 electrodes: one platinum, one hydrogen electrode for reference
				- difference is redox potential

	- The hydrogen couple 1/2H2 <-> H+ + e-
	- Well-drained soil Eh, **0.4 -0.7 volt**
	- Flooded conditions --> MUCH LOWER - negative , in warm, organic-matter-rich soils, Eh **-0.3V** can be found
		- e.g. warm tropical regions, organic rich soils, where soil is flooded
			- warm very active microbes and roots consuming the O2 more
			- organic matter is food for microbes 
			- also adds electron acceptors (organic matter)
	- Redox potential is very consistently related to O2  content in soil

## Factors affecting soil aeration
- Drainage of excess water
- rates of respiration in the soil
- subsoil vs topsoil 
- Soil heterogeneity (spatial heterogeneity)
	- poorly aerated pockets in a profile
	- some anaerobic sites throughout soil - some organisms prefer it - e.g. if they need red pigments that are susceptible to oxidation
	- e.g. red pigments protected inside aggregates 
- Seasonal differences - changes in the temperature
- Effects of vegetation
	- root respiration
		- e.g. CO2 released in summer
	- evapotranspiration
		- lowers the water content of the soil

example:
snow cover - reduces mass flow (except for temperature change)
frozen ice layer - severely limits mass flow and diffusion in the soil


## Cation Leaching

- high CO2 = abundant dissolved CO2, so abundant carbonic acid in the soil solution, if the pH is not too low
- H+ tend to displace other cations from exchange sites
- Bicarbonate is a mobile anion, can accompany the positive charge of a displaced cation, allowing it to move downward
- High CO2 --> increased leaching of nutrient cations, electrical conductivity and reduced pH of soil solution

- at lower pHs the H+ makes the HCO3 reverse more, so there is less of the bicarbonate ion

### Temperature Effects
- nutrient deficiencies, especially P, often appear in young plants in early spring with low temperature when the roots are not growing very actively
	- young plants do not have large root system
- frost damage
- permafrost and global climate change
- in cool temperate regions, soil temperature often limits the productivity of forest sites


### Notes from class:
### High CO2 - Carbon Dioxide
- soil solution has to be **charged** neutral when leached
- for bicarbonate ion to be leached, requires cations - that is how cations are leached
- CO2 will push reaction to carbonic acid which will push carbonic acid to dissociate reversibly
- it will become acidified after the long term
	- could neutralize solution with a lot of carbonate pushing it back
- At pH 6.37 (close to neutral), half of the carbonic acid is dissociated
- At pH 4.37 (high acidity), there is very little bicarbonate ion in solution, minimal dissociation, then pushes back to carbonic acid, H+ consumes the bicarbonate, then lowers solubility of CO2 (high carbonic acid), pushing it also back to CO2


Increased CO2 conc. in the soil air 
- • High CO2 concentration lead to abundant dissolved CO2 and abundant carbonic acid in the soil solution, if the pH is not too low- 
- • H+ tend to displace other cations from exchange sites - 
- • Bicarbonate is a mobile anion, can accompany the positive charge of a displaced cation, allowing it to move downward - 
- • Increased leaching of:
	- nutrient cations, 
	- electrical conductivity,
	- and reduced pH of the soil solution

- increase in Aluminum

- Oxidized and reduced forms of several important elements
- in general, well-oxygenated soils will have them in oxidized form, and in waterlogged (low O2), will be in reduced form (C,N,S,Fe,Mn)
- all organic carbon is a microbial process, but in waterlogged soils, it is kind of an incomplete reaction
	- alchohol or methane in soil - soil is very poorly aerated. Carbon is the last to be reduced. 
- In sequence of their reduction (i.e. a decrease in oxygen, the nitrogen will be reduced first![[Pasted image 20250203161746.png]]
- ******* Sequence of reducibility : N, Mn, Fe, S, C
Fe -0.44 
Mn - -1.17 
S -0.407
N - -0.23
C -0.106 - -0..481
02 - 0.695


## how poor aeration affects plant growth 3 ways:

1. growth of plants (roots) curtailed
2. absorption of nutrients and water is decreased
3. formation of certain inorganic compounds that are toxic

- Some trees on wet sites have become well adapted -large lenticels and aerenchyma tissue
	- growth rate will still be less optimal

How to improve aeration:
- loosen soil by root balls; loosen root balls
- core cultivation to increase soil aeration - think holes in grass - must remove
