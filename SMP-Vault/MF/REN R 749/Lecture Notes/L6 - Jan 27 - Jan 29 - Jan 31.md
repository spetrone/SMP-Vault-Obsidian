Engineering properties of attenberg limits

### Plastic Index 
PI = LL - PL
- can be used to determine to some extend the minerology
roughly a percentage (as each limit is a percentage)
- ***soils with high plasticity index*** (greater than about 25) - expansive clays - make poor roadbeds or foundations
	- can take up a lot of liquid before behaving like liquid
	- not good for logging roads, highways - moves up and down as moisture content changes
- a large ratio of PI to LL (& PI < 25) : many clayey soils
- small ratio of PI to LL (& PI << 25): many silty soils and many fine grained soils with moderate to high content of well decomposed OM
	- once plastic, won't be able to take in much water before going to liquid state
	- not good soils for construction
#### 3 Categories for Plasticity Index:
(%)
PI <7 ***slightly***,
PI 7-17 ***medium***,
PI >17 ***highly plastic***



## Well-graded vs Poorly-graded soil
- well-graded soil - many particle size classes well-presented
- poorly-graded : just one or two size classes dominating
- no slope/horizontal slope - none being retained
 ( area under the curve against y axis for that range on x axis)
 - depends on uniformity and curvature

- In the Unified System, a coarse grained soil, 

- **“gravels”,**
- >50% retained on No. 200 sieve and 
- >50% retained on the No. 4 sieve) must meet the following criteria to be considered well graded
1) Coefficient of uniformity (Cu) D60/D10 > 4
2) Coefficient of curvature (Cc) 1 < D302/(D10 x D60) < 3

- sands In the Unified System, a coarse grained soil, “sands”,
- >50% retained on the No. 200 sieve, 
- ***<50%*** retained on the No. 4 sieve - i.e. more smaller grains retained (if more, then it is gravel)
- must meet the following criteria to be considered well graded
1) Coefficient of uniformity (Cu) D60/D10 > 6
2) Coefficient of curvature (Cc) 1 < D302/(D10 x D60) < 3

- coefficient of uniformity - tests the span of the curve
- coefficient of curvature - tests any gaps in the distribution in grade size


### For Fine-grained Soils:
- look at liquid limits and plastic limits rather than grading
< 50% retained on no. 200 sieve
  - > 50% pass through no. 200 sieve
Empirical Relationship:
![[Pasted image 20250127094534.png]]
- below A-line: non-plastic
- Above A-line: plastic (high clay content)
- high liquid limit > 50 (H)
- low liquid limit < 50 (L)
- L - low (below 50)
- H - high (above 50)
- M-silt
- C - clay
- O - organic

## Unified classification System for Soil Material

- use symbols to describe behavior based on two letter designation determining
	- particle size distribution
	- organic matter content
	- attenberg limits
- e.g. GW - gravel, well-graded
- Borderline classification require dual symbols:
	- GW-GC (well-graded gravel, and gravel with high clay content)
- To aid in predicting the engineering behavior of different soils

##### Method
##### Coarse and Fine Soils
Use classification [chart](obsidian://open?vault=SMP-Vault&file=MF%2FREN%20R%20749%2FLecture%20Notes%2FUnified_Soil_Classification_System-RENR749.pdf)
Determine gravels vs. sands
- how much is going through #200 sieve determines fine vs coarse
- how much is retained on #4 sieve (50%) - above - gravel, below 50% retained, sand
- then how much through #200 --> for both 
	- <5% clean gravel
	- > 12% gravel with fines
		- must check plasticity chart
	- **5-12% - need to use dual symbols** -> see above for Cu to determine if well-graded or poorly-graded
- 50% smaller than number 200 sieve - classifying fine grained soil material
	- use LIQUID LIMIT
#### Organic soil classification test
- for high organic matter content:
	- find liquid limit based on:
	- oven-dried increases *hydrophobicity*, lowering the liquid limit - so it will become liquid more easily
	- essentially, you dry both soils - one with oven, one with air, and then test them for LL and look at the ratio
	- air-dried still has some moisture in it too, which ends up being counted in LL
	`(Oven-dried soil LL/Air-dried soil LL) < 75 -- then it is organic material

### Layers Commonly Encountered in an Unpaved Road
- **surface** : *water-shedding* layer with high shear strength. GW-GC intergrade is ideal
	- if not shedding - accumulation of water with our freeze/thaw weather conditions can cause potholes
- **Base:** the main load-spreading layer for load-bearing
- **Sub-base** (sometime omitted) resists erosion, resists pumping (when surface is uneven this causes pumping), facilitates drainage, insulates against frost penetration/frost heaving, and breaks capillary water columns (do not want water coming up through the sub-base - e.g. frost heaving)
- **subgrade** - the foundation or supporting soil for a road or airfield - usually original soil but can be built
#### Soil Engineering and Physical Properties Based on Unified System of Soil Classification

(unified class, sub-grade, base, pot'l frost action, compressibility, drain-expansion, CBR age)

#### CBR (California Bearing Ratio)

##### Comparison of Soil Engineering and Physical Properties

- in general:
	- coarse soils and well-graded soils have superior properties for road construction and engineering applications

## CBR - California Bearing Ratio
- test load tested against a standard load of crushed rocks
- test compression by certain depth and record the amount of force applied (e.g. compress by 2.5 or 5 cm and record the applied load)
- same for all materials
- unitless number - test load as percentage of standard load
- as moisture content changes, bearing strength will change

`CBR = ((test load)/(standard load)) x 100`

if CBR is > **60**, high bearing strength, then it will have a high bearing ratio - less subject to vehicles getting stuck --> you want a high bearing ratio for heavy vehicles
	- <40,low bearing strength, the road is unsafe for heavy vehicles


### Soil Bearing Strength and Trafficability
- **Penetrometer test:** originally developed for trafficability estimates for military vehicles - quick field test
- most important depth: **15cm - 30cm** because if there is not enough strength in that depth it cannot support the weight of the vehicle and the vehicle will get stuck, even if the surface has a stronger penetrometer reading - the sub-layer is critical; so if surface is bad but sub-soil is good, then it is still safe to drive on that soil
- done on site directly on moisture content in field
- Readings are used to calculate the "rating cone index" (RCI)
```
RI - remolding index the ratio of remolded soil strength to original strength
CI - measured cone index, with a cone penetrometer

RCI = CI x RI
``` 
- remolded soil is disturbed soil - e.g. driven on - and the soil structure and strength has been changed - generally will lower strength of soil
- the lower strength has to be factored in, hence RCI

Examples of vehicles based on the vehicle weight, tire size/area distribution, and RCI:

## Drainage Rates
e.g. application: septic tank and drain field constituting a standard system for onsite wastewater treatment
- drain field needs to be a minimum of 1.2 m to water table or bedrock or not enough depth for soil to filter wastewater

##### Percolation test - Minutes/cm
- to evaluate the soil's carrying capacity (downward movement through soil of water already infiltrated in soil) for sewage effluent from a septic tank
- bigger number (min/cm) the slower the percolation
- measure multiple points on sites - there can be large spatial variation - and take the average

1. Dig hole 10-cm diameter to drainfield depth
2. 5 cm layer of gravel, soak for > 4hr or steady state or 24hr
	1. minimize disturbance to bottom of hole during the test  - could change drainage rate
	2. the 4 hour or until constant (steady state at 24hr) to prevent change in drainage rate with expansive clays in the soil - will take a long time for the water to be taken in by the clay minerals 
		1. if you don't do that you could be overestimating the **long term*** percolation rate 
			1. you want the clay saturated as if it expands it will squeeze the pore space and that is the rate you want to measure as this is the long term percolation rate
3. with with 15 cm water above gravel layer
4. time required for water to drop 2.5 cm (or the drop over a 30 min period)

### Key Drainage Values
- Maximum permitted percolation rate for a septic tank drainfield: 25 min/cm 
- Minimum depth to a water table or bedrock or other drainage restrictions: 1.2m
- Distance to open water : > 30m
- Avoid sites with extremely rapid percolation
