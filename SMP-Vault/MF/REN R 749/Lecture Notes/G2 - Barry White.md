- economics drives foretry
- LiDAR
	- light detection and ranging
- like to be able to look for streams
	- difficult to see with aerial photography
	- 50% of streams you cannot see 
		- someone goes in to put in a well site or go harvest and then these things jump out. 
		- skidders run through and tear them up
- also want to look for wet soils
	- susceptible to compaction 
	- often soil is not frozen, even in winter, especially with a lot of snow cover - will tear the soil apart
	- Far easier to plan ahead 2-3 years and know what the site actually looks like
### What they do:
- Predict where water table is
	- trying to do it based on the surface; violated all principles of hydrology
- take every cell of lidar-derived bare earth and give it a tilt
	- with enough to the same point - starts a stream channel
		- then an ephemeral draw
		- then it carves out a channel
		- they are interested in what you can't see
		- don't think about springs or underground flow - too complicated
- their maps:
	- simplicity
	- effeciveness
	- widespread acceptance
	- cost effective
	- value added

- for oil & gas can estimate flow and flow direction

biodiversity mapping

- do you have your algorithms and methods published / are they open source?
- how are they different from other large-scale hydrographic datasets?I
- Do you know what kinds of positions would be a good fit for foresters with computing and LiDAR skills - will that be a good skillset in industry?
