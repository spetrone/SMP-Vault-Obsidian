### Soil Formation

Triangle (soil-plant-environment relationships)
- **plant** - species composition, growth requirements
- **soil** (internal processes) - also related to parent material
- **environment** (climate, landscape, parent material, pollutants)

##### 5 soil forming factors:
1. time
2. vegetation
3. climate
4. landscape
5. parent material
*influence processes below*

##### Soil forming Processes
Soil: **open system** of energy and transformations in the solum
1. Additions
2. Losses
3. Translocations
4. Transformations
*of material and energy* - degree and speed of these four processes determines soil

## Land forms/Landforms
Soil formation and distribution are affected by land forms

- **Land form (topography):** the three-dimensional shape of the ground surface

- **Landform:** a feature of the earth's surface with a distinctive form that can be attributed to the *dominance of particular geologic processes or particular structures* in the course of its development


## Land Forms (Topography)
1. **Relief** - the difference in elevation between the high and low points of a land surface
2. **Frequency** - the periodicity of recurring portions of a landscape, expressed as number per km
3. **Slope range** - range in the slope gradient for similar sites on the land form(s) of concern
4. **Topographic class** - a range in slope gradient, adopted for soil mapping purposes
	1. class used specifically for mapping - cannot map all

- **Elevation** - height above a datum (reference point), usually sea level
	- ecological factor - temperature
- **Position** - 7--> crest, upper, middle, lower, tie, depression, level
	- moisture in soil (hydrology), nutrients (less movement), stability, erosion, slop movement/stability
	- lose soil on upper slope, receiving soil in the toe of the slope --> differences in thickness
- **Surface shape** - concave, convex, straight
- **Slope gradient** - angle that a slope makes with the horizontal
	- expressed as % or degrees
- **Aspect** - direction a slope faces
	- differences in energy - sunlight - temperature


### Terms used in Landform Classification
See *Chapter 18 of Canadian System of Soil Classification*
5. Surface expression
	1. **Fan** : shape
	2. **Terraced** : material deposited at different times
		1. steep rise, then flat
	3. **Veneer** : *thickness* 10cm - 1M
	4. **Blanket** : *thickness* > 1M
	5. **Level :** < 2%
	6. **Inclined :** 2-70%
	7. **Steep :** >70%
	8. **Rolling :** > 5% > 1.6km
	9. **Undulating :** 2-5% < 0.8km in length - much smaller
	10. **Ridged** - small but very steep landforms

#### Morphological Landform Classification
- **Geological materials** and **surface expression** - the primary attributes in the field classification of landforms
- Geologic material (mineral)

	- **Eolian** - from wind - medium to fine sand and coarse silt, well sorted, grains typically rounded (the way the sand is moved by wind - process is saltation - a lot of friction occurring - **polishes** the sand particles)
		- see sand < **0.5** mm - otherwise too heavy for wind
		- don't see much coarse silt or silt (near **0.05 mm**) because they are blown further


	- **Colluvial** - brought down from high elevations/cliffs and deposited at bottom
		- Massive to moderately well stratified
			- depends on original geological material coming down from cliff and at what times
			- layers may have different particle sizes
		- non-sorted to poorly sorted - uniformity of particle size per layer; if sorted - also stratified
		- from clay to boulders
			- depends on weathering; clay - chemical, physical -larger
		- gravity-induced movement

	- **Fluvial** - material that has been re-worked by water - flowing water carrying material from its origin until it is deposited
		- gravel and sand with a minor fraction of silt and clay
		- commonly moderately to well-sorted 
		- displays stratification - depends on speed of water flow
			- slower = finer
			- faster = larger
			- e.g. different floods deposit different sizes, depending on size of flood


	- **Lacustrine** - lake-formed soil / material deposited in a lake
		- commonly stratified fine sand, silt and clay deposited on the lake bed
		- all material carried into lake will be deposited onto the lake bed
		- fairly strong sorted - mechanism is the same as fluvial based on floods/water cycles/storms
		- material carried in summer vs winter/fall (before freezing) - some coarser, some finer
			- carried in summer - coarser (larger floods)
			- fall/winter - finer (smaller floods)
			- = wavs
			- have different color - summer - lighter, winter - darker
				- may be based on geological material/elevation, but also particle size (smaller particles tend to show up as darker)

	- **Morainal/ glacial till** - glacial deposits - till
		- well-compacted material
		- non-stratified
		- contains a heterogenous mixture of particle sizes
		- formed through glacial actions
		- deposited in warm cycles and during glacial retreat


	- **Saprolite** - material formed in-situ, has not been moved
		- chemically weathered rock
		- generally have low hardness, and are friable
		- mostly soft or friable and commonly retains the structure of the parent rock since it is not transported, but autochthonously formed in place
		- Typically in mid-latitudes - ~30 deg and 50-60 deg south and north

	- **Marine** - from seawater depositing material
		- clay, silt, sand or gravel
		- moderately well sorted 
			- different size of the waves
		- stratified
		- washed ashore by seawater/waves
		- very saline soils would be developed - problematic

Geological Material - Organic

- water is the main limitation of tree growth 
- **Bog** - formed with mosses - specifically sphagnum moss (most common) - most common in colder regions
	- water table very low - organic matter sitting above water table
	- organic matter could be a meter or more --> can then form organic soils
	- cold temperatures, high water table limit decomposition of organic matter
	- sphagnum or woody peat formed in **ombrotrophic** (nutrient-poor) conditions due to a slightly elevated level of the bog, thus disassociated from nutrient-rich groundwater or surrounding mineral soils 
		- water comes mostly from precipitation
		- therefore few minerals/nutrients
	- vegetation - mostly ***black spruce*** - doesn't require much nutrients, can handle high water table
- **Fen** - formed from sedge peat with inclusions of partially decayed stems of shrubs
	- **eutrophic** (nutrient rich) environment due to a *close association with mineral-rich waters*
	- vegetation - a lot of ***tamarack*** in the wetland
		- tamarack requires a lot more nutrients, can handle high water table
	- water table at or above ground surface
		- fed by ground water
			- filters nutrients more than swamp, therefore slightly less than swamp
- Swamp 
	- a peat-covered or peat-filled area with the water table at or above a peat surface in a eutrophic environment, predominately forested (woody species)
	- water table at or above ground surface
		- surface water
		- more nutrients than fen
