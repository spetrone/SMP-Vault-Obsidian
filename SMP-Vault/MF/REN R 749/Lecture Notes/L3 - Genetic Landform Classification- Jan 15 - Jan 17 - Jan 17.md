# Genetic Land form Classification

- emphasizes the **depositional environment*** which results in sediment formations of characteristic surface morphology and properties of the sediment
	- texture
	- degree of sorting
	- stratification/bedding
	- particle roundness


### 1. Landform of Till (Morainic)
- not modified by moving water

- **Glacial Drift** : all sediments
	1. in transport by glacier ice
	2. deposited by glacier ice
	3. predominantly of glacial origin made in glacial melt-water or in seawater
		1. glacial lakes
		2. or with seawater if the glacier is in connection with the sea and sediments deposit there
1. Glacier drift further classification - two kinds: 
	1. **till / nonstratified drift**
	2. **stratified drift** 


# 1. Till
  
  1. **Lodgement till** - the lower unit of the till, deposited from the base of a glacier, intense crushing and abrasion of particles from ice flow, leaving a compact till
1. **Ablation till:** deposited from drift in transport upon or within ice near the terminus of a melting glacier
		-  loose, noncompact, and may be coarser textured - meltwater removal of fine particles
		- reverse of lodgement (means "removal") - taken up by glacier/removed and then deposited when it melts
		- not affected by heavy weight of glacier - fairly loose deposition
		- could still have fine particles depending on weathering and mechanisms
		- often coarser - if meltwater removes fine particles
- can have both:
	- lodgement till on bottom
	- ablation till on top 

#### 2. Ground Moraine
- comparatively uniform thickness of drift, lodgement and ablation tills, undulating plain with a random pattern of depressions, local relief <6m, usually maks the topography of underlying bedrock
- from non-moving water mechanisms - i.e. when glacier is not moving
- **ground moraine** usually between two end moraines

##### 3. **End moraine**: usually from stagnant active melting front of glacier
- different layers - different seasons at melting front of glacier
- no flowing water water deposited in place as glacer melts
- discontinuous ridgelike accumulation of drift (till or till and stratified drift) at the glacier margin
- perpendicular 
- local relief < 50 m in end moraines of ice sheets
- local relief < 300 m if valley glaciers
- relief related to slope of valleys
	- steep - have higher buildup, greater local relief
- 2 kinds:
2. **Terminal  end moraine** - perpendicular to movement of glacier
3. **Lateral end moraine** - parallel (and pushed aside) of movement of glacier
	1. **medial moraine** : when two glaciers meet

##### 4. Hummocky disintegration moraine
4. disintegration of thin, stagnant ice in the margin zone (e.g. 10km wide) of a (melting) glacier 
	-  local relief up to 10  m
	- magnitude of local relied depends on how much material was held in glacier
	-  rounded mounds in landscape - numerous not singular
- from different speeds of melting at glacier front and to do with thrusting moving debris to the surface - less on surface - melts faster leaving ice cores
	- the mound actually accumulates in the depression during this process 
#### 4. Linear Disintegration ridges
- three possible mechanisms:
	- formed during ice stagnation and disintegration OR
	- fillings of crevasses in ice mass wasting and washing in of superglacial drift OR
	- squeezing up of water saturated till into sub-glacial crevasses
- straight or curved ridges (1 - 10 m high and up to 10 km in length) of till 
	- most likely curved
	- length depends on length of crevasse

#### 5. Washboard Moraine or De Geer Moraines
- small end moraines or a thrust feature into cracks in an ice sheet back of its termius
- large scale - washboard 
- ridges are winter positions of glacier margins in contact with a water body
- receding glacier - moves back and deposites again on a new line
- ridges of 1 to 5 m high, a few metres to > 2km in length
- spaced 30 - 200 km apart, singly or in groups

#### 6. Drumlins 
- commonly an ice *advance* feature representing both ice erosion and depostion of glacer drift, predominantly till
- like an inverted spoon shape
- varies from entirely bedrock to bedrock with a veneer of till to till only
- an elliptical hill like the inerted bowl of a spoon with the long axis paralleling direction of ice movement
- cause not known - may be from deposition against a ridge or large iceflow forms, may be formed in ocean, may be from erosion process/removal of till, may be from distribution of material in glacier
- commonly length is 1-2 km width 400-600 m and height 5-50m
- commonly occur in groups of up to a few hundred == "drumlin field"

#### 7. Flutings
- similar to drumlins, formed by actively flowing glacer
- from glacier cutting into the bedrock
- parallel ridges with intervening grooves make up a fluted surface
- ridges up to 20 km long, up to 100m wide, and up to 25 m high

### 2. Landform of stratified drift Built in Flowing Water (Glaciofluvial)
https://www.coolgeography.co.uk/A-level/AQA/Year%2012/Cold%20environs/Fluvioglacial/Fluvioglacial%20landforms.htm

![[Pasted image 20250115094520.png|400]]
- layering occurring
- have common origin related to thin, virtual stagnant ice in the terminal zone of a glacier, commonly wide and overlying low relief terrain
- stratification (can be mild or significant):
	- speed of water will determine the particle size being carried
	- different time periods of material carried by water

5. Esker
	- very common in glacial landforms
	- as stratified drift deposited by  melt-water stream
	-  long round belts following shape of the melt-water stream
		- can have delta form alongside esker (often into former glacial lake)
	
6. Kame Terrace
	- stratified drift laid down mainly by streams between a glacier and the side of a valley and left as a constructional terrace after melting of the glacier
	- top pitted by kettles
	- difference between esker and kame terrace - depends on location of deposition - alongside glacier beside slope == kame terrace, otherwise, it is an esker
![[Pasted image 20250115095006.png]]

7. Kame
- sediment deposited in crevasses and other openings
- often from sediments deposited when pushed up against a receding glacier
- sediment deposited as deltas and fans built outward from ice or inward against ice which opon melting collapses leaving an isolated irrefular mound

8. Kettles
- melting of a mass of glacier ice that was entirely or partly buried in drift
- usually circular basin, up to 2km diameter, most <8m deep
- landform is often pitted in a fairly flat plain

9. Outwash
- well sorted stratified drift built by streams beyond a glacer, streams originate several kms upstream
- often somewhat far 
	- single *fan* against a terminus of glacier
	- coalescence of fan
	- *valley train* - long, narrow body of outwash with a braided stream pattern
		- form channels; size of front changing causes course to change
	- *outwash plain* - when the opening is fairly wide
	- *pitted outwash plain* - an outwash plain with kettles

### 3.Glaciolacustrine -  Landforms of sediments built in standing water
- lacustrine environment --> water accumulates in a depression
- Some stratified drift was deposited in temporary basins defined on one side by glacier ice ***(proglacial lake)*** 
- Glacial lake sediments may include :
	- **till** - non-stratified glacial material
	- **delta sediments** - carried by moving water
	- **bottom sediments** - deposited by mostly non-moving lakes - carried at a much slower rate - usually much finer than delta sediments
	- **rafted erratics** - piece of rock deposited by glacier - usually much different from size of native sediments - often from mountains
	- **shore sediments** - sediments that occur near the shore, at a sea or lake environment - pushed but not suspended by moving water - coarse texture relative to bottom sediments
- Lacustrine Plain - specific landform for sediments built in standing water / lacustrine environment
	- mainly silts and clays if bottom sediments
	- coarser if deltaic sediments
	- Stratification - **varve*** - a layer
		- seasonal deposit consisting of a **summer (light coloured**) from larger floods
		- and a **winter (dark colored**) bed (or lamina)
		- colour also influenced by water content
#### 4. Colluvial landform
- **talus** - most common:
	- the slope of rock fragments at the foot of a cliff or mountain - from weathering, piled up (by gravity)
	- Caused by erosion
	- difference in size:
		- type of weathering - more chemical weathering / rock type more susceptible to weathering - smaller scree
		- physical weathering only - large scree
	- AKA scree
	- fan shaped
	- slope of a talus is rarely greater than 40d, may be further eroded

-
#### 5. Alluvial landform 
- used mostly interchangeably with fluvial
	- ***alluvial*** - depositions that occur as water carrying sediments is just leaving the valley (e.g. as fans)
	- ***fluvial*** - referring to material that has already been carried by a stream or river from and upland to lowland location and meets depressed area - and material deposits there.
- **Flood plain** - fluvial - from overflow
	- usually low gradient/fairly flat (2-3 degrees); water flows slowly; typically complex from channel changing 
	- ***complex layering*** - from flood events, and both addition/removal of deposits
	- flat or nearly flat land adjacent to a stream or river that experiences occasional or periodic flooding
	- these are accumulations of sand, gravel, silt or clay
- Flat or nearly flat land adjacent to a stream or river that experiences occasional or periodic flooding 
- These are accumulations of sand, gravel, silt, and/or clay
#### 6.  Eoalian - from wind
- May be subdivided into:
	- **sand - dunes***
		- dune-shaped
		- because the particles are bigger, harder to be moved - resistance against sand deposited earlier, so sand get pushed up on dune.
	- **loess - silt ***  ("lois" or "luss")
		- flat surface
	- both types imply *deflation* (removal by wind action) of outwash and other masses of sediment containing sand and silt
	- most in northern latitudes are of Pleistocene age (18.M - 10,000yrs), and directly or indirectly related to glaciers.

##### 1. Sand Dunes

![[Pasted image 20250117094958.png]]
	- occur in groups - dune field near source of sand
		- e.g. margins of outwash or lee sides of coarse alluvium in valleys
	- well-sorted fin and medium sand
	- xeric species grow here
	- 5 Kinds:
		1. **Beach dunes** -hummocks bordering beaches
			1. hummocky pattern - shifting wind pattern
		2. **Barchan dune** - crescent-shaped with horns pointing downwind; occur in deserts
			- uni-directional winds;
		3. **Transverse dune** - wave-like; ridge traverse wind direction; occurs with abundant sand,
			-  wind doesn't change direction a lot
			-  little vegetation
		5. **U-shaped dune** - parabolic, U-shaped opening upwind
			-  deposition of sand along lee and lateral margins of a blowout of an older dune
			- in semiarid and humid climates
			- usually partial vegetation
		6. **Longitudinal dun**e - long, straight, ridge like, parallel to wind
		- slight variations of wind direction that are diagonal to eachother, varying by small angles
- cross bedding - layers of dunes deposited in different directions forming sedimentary 


- formation of a dune ridge during uniform and nonuniform wind direction and velocity
- 3 ways it can be moved around:
	1. saltation - pushed by wind and jumps forward
	2. creep  - not stable
	3. suspension - carried further

dunes - 3 forces in play
10. wind moved sand particles up - saltation
11. dragging force - resistance of particles
12. gravitational force - trying to pull it down

-**cross strata** get moved across landscape by wind, then combined with erosion this creates cross-strata


##### 2. Loess
- non-stratified sediment - some lamination possible 
- can be quite dry - porous nature - water-holding capacity not high
- predominantly ***silt-sized particles*** deposited **as a sheet (blanket or veneer)**
	- can be several meters deep
- homogeneous, porous (not as porous as sand dunes), friable, slightly coherent (strength), often calcareous (depends on source - carrying calcium carbonates), fine-grained, silty, pale, yellow or buff windblown sediment
	- too much clay - structureless soil - amorphous block
- Loess grains are angular with little polishing or rounding
- grains not bonded strongly
- subject to erosion losses by water and wind, and soils underlain by loess tend to be excessively drained
	- do not want to disturb vegetation or soil will be eroded
	- when protected they can be very productive
		- can hold water and nutrients much better than sandy soil but not as good as soil with high clay content
- since transported in suspension - less friction than when sand moved - therefore not rounding
