- get eBook for Ecology and Management of Forest Soils
- Get download copy of Canadian System of Soil Classification

Mid term: Friday, Feb. 14
Final: April 15, 1 PM

both are open-book - can bring lecture notes, etc. 
- not seen huge difference in marks



### Use of soils in forest Industry
- Determine extent of specific management zones and their soils
	- where to plant what and fertilize what
- Identify wet weather logging sites 
	- avoid machinery on certain sites (on sites prone to damage), and requires soils classification to determine which can be logged in wet weather
- Site preparation - for planting mostly
	- identify needs based on soil type
	- e.g. mounding on wet sites
	- e.g. drainage, is it good? Is water table high?
	- e.g. managing impermeable layers
	- e.g. managing heavily compacted soils and increasing rooting depths
- Identify nutritional needs and rate of fertilization
	- e.g. based on geology (in Florida), can determine fertility of soil
- Calculation of liming rates (if soil acidification is a concern)
	- using soil pH and CEC that determines the buffering capacity of the soil
- Estimate site productivity
	- soils information/classification needed - a combination:
		- depth, pH level, nutrient level
- Water quality and yield/run-off rates
	- pore size distribution (soil texture) & therefore, infiltration rate
	- surface soil condition - organic horizons on surface, surface cover, snow/freezing
- Stream/fisheries protection & managing sediment (related to ^)
- Choose vegetation control chemicals (herbicides) and application rates, based on:
	- (1) SOM - if high, the organic matter  (once highly decomposed = humus) could interact with (adsorb) chemicals, (high SA & colloidal properties)
	- (2) Soil Texture
		- especially the clay content - high SA
	- Adsorption from (1) or (2) will inhibit root uptake of herbicides, and would need to increase application rate of herbicide.
	
- Assign species/families/varieties to sites
	- have diff requirements for moisture, nutrients, etc.
- Determine the ROI of cultural treatments to allocate stand establishment budget
	- soil fertility etc. - budget more for high productivity
