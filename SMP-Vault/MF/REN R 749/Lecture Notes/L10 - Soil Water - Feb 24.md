- importance : water's effect on forest productivity; often the limiting factor
	- determine types of trees that can be grown
	- functioning of most soil and plant processes

- how:
	- structure of the water molecule - asymmetry of H20 causes polarity
	- intimate association with solid particles in the soil


### Soil Water Properties

- **adhesion** : ability of water molecules to adhere to other surfaces/subjects, especially hydrophilic surfaces (as most soil surfaces are) - they have negative charged sites that attract position charge on water molecule;
	- may also form hydrogen bonds between soil surfaces and oxygen on water molecule
	- from strong attraction to hydrophilic surfaces

- **Cohesion** : attraction between water particles to form a mass

- **Surface tension**
	

- **Capillary rise:**
	- `h(cm) = 0.15/r(cm)`
	- - due to adhesion - pulls water surface up along surface
	- pulls up until the pulling force up from adhesion and surface tension is equal to the forces pushing down (gravity)
		- there is a limit per each soil depending on pore space
		- defines the capillary fringe = the upper limit of the capillary rise from the water table
	- higher in smaller tubes/smaller diameter pores
		- in soil there are not uniform tubes, the measure is by the grain size/pore size, and defined by vertical height in soil
			- can find the equivalent capillary tube size/effective pore space size by the height of the capillary fringe
		- larger diameter: faster but lower maximum height
		- small diameter: slower but higher maximum height
			- particles attract water and also further slow down the water movement

### Water Availability

- **Field Capacity** :-
	- operationally-defined term, fill the field with water, let the soil be saturated with water, then let it freely drain for 24-48 hours; that point the water that is held in the pore space by gravitational spaces is drained away - let gravity work on free-draining water; the remaining soil water is the field capacity. - so after those hours, measure the soil water.
	- empirically commonly the energy level is : -0.033 MPa 
		- depends on soil though
		- would need to apply this much force to stop the water from flowing - that is why it is negative (not pushing, but stopping flow)
	
- **Permanent wilting point**  (-1.5 MPa)
	- the water content where the plants are experiencing water drought conditions; they are wilting; cannot maintain turgor pressure and leaves are wilting.
		- if the plant recovers with more water added - it is not at the permanent wilting point
		- the plant must be permanently wilted -if it does not recover with added water
		- depends on the plant species as well
	- many forest trees have PWP as low as -2.5 MPa
		- e.g. douglas fir has much lower wilting point

#### Soil Water Potential Concept
- water energy status
	- potential vs kinetic energy
	- retention, movement, uptake, translocation


water potential
- unsaturated soil - matrix potential is factor that is in effect
- saturated soil - submergence potential (hydrostatic pressure) is in effect
	- free-water surface or ground water surface
		- below water table is water column which adds to the soil water potential
		- 
#### Components of Water Potential
Components of ψ • Ψ = (ψm or ψs) + ψg + ψo + ψa 
• ψm = matric, ≤0, applies at or above a free water surface (fws), ψm =0 @ fws
• ψs = submergence, ≥0, applies at or below fws, ψs =0 @ fws (hydrostatic pressure) • ψg = gravitational, 0 at an arbitrarily chosen reference level (eg sea level) 
	- considered lowest at sea level
• ψo = osmotic, ≤0, 0 for pure water 
	- as soon as there are solutes
• ψa = air pressure p

- **available water** difference between field capacity and wilting coefficient
	- more with loams and clays
		
	- more fine particles to attract the water - water is attracted
		- but the more attracted they are, the less available they are
		- also more micropore spaces holding water that is not available
			- total pore space is finite in those soils even with finer particles - it plateaus out
	- more pore space with finer materials - therefore more water holding capacity / volume available in the pore space

	- silt loam is the best texture for providing water to plants - for available water

#### Effects of Soil Organic Matter
-field capacity soil water content increases faster than the permanent wilting point with more organic matter content than without/less (tested with 1-6% organic matter)
- How?
	- improve**s soil structure** - increases the mesopore space available in the soil
	- act like a sponge - the organic molecules attract large amounts of water molecules and have high surface area
		- the permanent wilting point still increases slightly because some of the water molecules still get held very tightly
		
### Soil Water Content Vs. Water Potential
- water potential dramatically decreases with decrease in water
- soil structure impacts pore size distribution and effects macro pore space
	- lose total volume of pore space with degraded soil structure
		- decrease macro pore space, increase meso pore space and micro pore space
	- impacted in forestry by soil compaction
- meso pore space most important for field capacity

Red line is field capacity (-0.033MPa)



Points:
-  Field capacity (-0.033 MPa)
-  Permanent wilting point (-1.5 MPa). Many forest trees have PWP as low as –2.5 MPa
- Water closer to field capacity is more available to plants (rapidly available vs. slowly available)
- hygroscopic coefficient : **the percentage of water that is absorbed and held in equilibrium by a soil in a saturated atmosphere**.
	- a few layers of water molecules being held tightly to soil particles
		- not very available
