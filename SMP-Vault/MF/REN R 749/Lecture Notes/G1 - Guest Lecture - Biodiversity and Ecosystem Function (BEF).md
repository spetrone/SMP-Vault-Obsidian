- **biodiversity:** the variety of life, including variation among genes, species, ecosystems and functional traits

- **Functional trait:** distinct phenotypic character of an organism. May be inherited, environmentally determined, or a combination e.g. specific leaf area, seed mass, wood density

- **Functional diversity** - range of functional traits involved in contributing to ecosystems processes

- Why? - biodiversity under unprecedented threat - species going extinct 100-2000x than background rate; over-exploitation, invasive species, climate change

Why biodiversity matters:
- **Ecosystem functions:** are ecological processes that control the fluxes of energy, nutrients and organic matter through an environment (e.g. primary production ,nutrient cycling)

- **Ecosystem services:** the suite of benefits that ecosystems provide to humanity (food, wood, fresh water, climate regulation, etc.)

-  General relationship exists in which biodiversity levels influence overall ecosystem function.
- In an ecosystem, individual organisms and species provide unique contributions to different ecological processes and often influence multiple processes at a time
- High levels of biodiversity help sustain a larger number of ecosystem processes, enhancing overall ecosystem functioning and productivity


More advanced BEF studies progressed over time
	e.g. first plant diversity experiment ***Tillman*** 1994 - manipulated plants (0-16) and measured productivity by biomass
- higher diversity had greater biomass production and stability over time
	- 80% of experiments had positive net diversity effect
- Tree biodiversity experiments in China are the largest
- Stand volume increases with time with greater biodiversity
- Species removal on islands - rather than build up a gradient - better for islands
	- after many years, the islands with the most species had higher cover
	- biodiversity could increase the overall production
- Global forest inventory - productivity and tree species richness - strong positive relationship
	- observation data
- Chen et al. 2025 - Nature
	- 452 experiments across various systems, including grasslands, forests, wetlands, croplands and aquatic systems

Why higher productivity with higher biodiversity?
1.  **Resource partitioning** - niche complementarity
	1. e.g. some species will use nitrate, some will use ammonium - so nutrients will be used more completely
	2. growth times - some grow more in May, some in June/July - so different times for using nutrients and water - less waste of nutrients and water - use it more completely and support more biomass production
	3. different heights - better and more complex use of space
2. **Abiotic Facilitation :** a plant species benefiting another plant species changes to the abiotic properties of the environment such as its microclimate, soil, chemical properties, or soil physical properties, can also contribute to the positive effect on diversity on ecosystem functions
	1. e.g. pH, mobilize soil phosphorus, nitrogen fixation, long roots - hydraulic re-distribution in soil, 
3. **Biotic feedbacks from other tropic levels** - higher diversity communities drive the absolute abundance of individual specialist pathogens to lower levels, thereby resulting in overyielding ecosystem
	1. will harbor more diverse arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) communities - which in turn can expand the total niche space utilized by the plant community and result in increased performance of the higher diversity mixture


- more resilient to drought - mitigate impacts of climate change - some species are drought resistant - or synergistic effect 

Soil carbon and nutrients
- **Increase litter decomposition** - different leaves may decompose more quickly, and there may be more diverse decomposers and soil biomass --> more/faster decomposition
- more soil carbon and nutrients
- **Priming effect** - new carbon to soil stimulates old carbon - stimulates microbial activity which increases decomposition of all the carbon
- Other nutrients will be consumed more completely - less leaching and erosion
	- Nitrogen and phosphorus will go back to soil in organic forms -- long term may be more in soil
- Species evenness increased organic horizon C and N accumulation via enhancing thickness
	- species composition impacts C and N
	- **Chen et al 2023 - Nature***
- Tree Functional Diversity increased soil C and N accumulation in the mineral soil horizon
- Tree species richness increased soil C and N accumulation visa their positive relationship with functional diversity
- Plant diversity increased soil N availability and cycling
- The diversity effects on soil N availability and cycling shift from negative in young stands to positive in older stands


Phosphorus - ***Chen et al. 2022***
- Plant diversity increases soil P cycling (P moves slowly) with more pronounced increases in the rhizosphere than in bulk soil
- Available soil P is used more completely in more diverse mixtures


BEF relationships
- are real and large
- often caused by complementarity and facilitation
- extend beyond productivity to encompass critical soil functions
