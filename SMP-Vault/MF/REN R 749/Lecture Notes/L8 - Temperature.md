# Soil Temperature
- many optimal temperatures for microbial processes 
- for most cop species ~25C
- high temperature is a requirement for some tree species (fire adapted) to regenerate
	- e.g. serotinous cones requiring heat to open up
- forest fire is a requirement in fire-adapted ecosystem
	- without it, will change species composition
- pathogens killed after 50C often
- 50C is roughly maximum bare soil conditions - maybe in dry dessert it could be more
- Biological 0 is 5C
	- below 5C there is minimal biological activity
- Seed germination requires a minimum temperature 


#### Properties and Processes affected by soil temperature
- evaporation (soil drying)
- damage of high temperatures to plants
- seed gemination
- plants' life cycle
- rates of chemical and biological reactions
	- decomposition
	- microbial processes (nil if <5C, optimum 35 to 40C)
	- Absorption and transport of water and nutrients
- optimum temperature is a range depending on region
	- e.g. loblolly pine (15-30C) vs red maple (12 to 18)
- Nutrient deficiencies (P) often appear in young plants in early spring
	- limited roots
	- limited microbial activity
- frost damage
	- cold stress damage
- permafrost and global climate change
	- permafrost thawing, enhanced mineralization of organic matter, broken down and released as greenhouse gases by microbes
	- positive feedback - increases temp, melts more permafrost, releases more gases - enhance climate change
- in cool, temperature regions, soil temperature often limits the productivity of forest sites
	- implications on timing of fertilization if applying it
	- in fall - nutrient leaching losses - leached/carried away with snowmelt if applied in the fall
- moss insulated soil, may shorten growing season in Boreal forest - stays frozen longer
	- if ground stays frozen, and if trees come out of dormancy, they can experience drought since they cannot uptake frozen water - **physiological drought**


law of the minimum: water level in the barrel, limited by the height of the shortest panel
	- so if temp. is a limitation, fertilizer will not help


- Soil temperature affected by (3 key aspects):
	- net amount of heat energy the soil absorbs
	- the heat energy required to bring about a given change in the temperature of a soil - == *heat capacity*
	- energy required for processes such as evaporation
		- evaporation takes away a lot of energy that could have gone to heat up the soil
- Energy budget:
	- suns rays intercepted by clouds, dust particles, scattered, reflected, absorbed
	- used to evaporate water, or radiated or reflected back to sky
	- when soil temperature is warmer, it will release energy to the air
		- moves towards equilibrium
		- different seasons, it is heating or cooling
	- only ~10% is absorbed by the soil

#### **Absorption and loss of solar energy:**
- **Aspect** : e.g. south vs. north
- e.g. in Virginia:
	- south-facing : pines (need less water)
	- north : hardwoods, broadleaf
- **Slope** : angle of incidence of sun rays - perpendicular is stronger, because of the surface area absorbing rays per unit area

![[Pasted image 20250205162037.png]]

- **albedo**: the percent of light being reflected
	- lower albedo, darker colour, more solar radiation absorbed
		- e.g. 0.1 to 0.2 for dark-colored, rough soil surface; 0.5 or more for smooth, light-colored surfaceq
	- determined by two factors: 
		- colour of the surface 
			- darker = lower albedo
		- moisture content - not part of albedo but changes the soil colour which changes the albedo
			- higher moisture = takes longer to heat up (this is separate from albedo)
		- texture of surface


- **Rain:** spring vs. summer
	- temperature of water from rain affects soil temperature
	- in spring - temperature of rain is warmer and warms soil
	- in summer - temperature of rain is cooler and cools the soil

- **Soil Cover:**
	- e.g. timber harvest practices
	- moss layer
	- understory vegetation
	- tree canopy closure 
	- implications in modulating soil temperature: instead of doing clearcut, can try to maintain some cover, there is some benefit - the canopy remaining, traps long-wave radiation from soil surface, minimizing loss of head from soil
		- partial canopy
		- less *fluctuations* in temperature

- cut forest has warmer, more deeply warm soils; most effective is bedded harvested area
	- bedded = lowered water table


### Soil Thermal Properties
- heat capacity - energy to warm up water  by one degree
- Latent head of vaporization (or condensation): 
	- energy required to vaporize water without a change in temperature
	- inverse of condensation energy
	- 540 kcal/kg-1  for water
- Latent heat of fusion
	- energy to required to convert ice at 0 to liquid water at 0
	- 80 kcal/kg
	- 1 cal/g = 4.18 J/g 
-
- Specific heat(lower case c) :
	- amount of energy to heat up soil by one degrees on mass basis
	- J/kg * C (celsius)
- Heat capacity (upper case C):
	- amount of energy to heat up soil by one degrees on a volume basis
	- J/m3 * C (celsius)
- soils with a high heat capacity are highly buffered against temperature changes
- water > solids > air
	- water is hardest to heat up
- solid OM (excluding fact that they are more porous) > solid soil materials
	- when compacted (remove pores) this is the case; but because of the pores, high organic soils, particularly upland (low water), then these soils should have a lower heat capacity.
- conversion: heat capacity to specific heater:
	- C(MJ/m3C) = c(kJ/kgC) x density (Mg/m3)
	- ![[Pasted image 20250205164104.png]]
- Soils with high heat capacity are highly buffered against temperature changes

## Calculating Specific Heat and Heat Capacity
- Soil is a multiple-component system, so we must look at the components:
	- solids, liquids, air
	- take specific heats of each component, and their percentages that make up the soil, and then calculate the specific heat of the entire multi-component soil system
	- *soil has air, but the specific heat of air is so small that it is ignored.*
	- Method: Calculate the ***weighted average***
	- e.g.
		- A : dry soil: 10g water/100g solids
		- B: wet soil: 30g water per 100 g solids
		- c =\ [c1 x m1 + c2 x m2] / [m1 + m2]
	- e.g. 
	- soil A vs soil B![[Pasted image 20250205164322.png]]
	- where speicif ic heat:
		- water 1.0 cal/g
		- mineral soil 0.2 cal/g
	- #RENR749exam - there is another example to practice in the L8 slides
	- For Heat Capacity, same method, but with heat capacity rather than specific heat 

# Soil Thermal Properties
## Heat Energy Transfer - Conductivity

- related to the **thermal conductivity o**f soils (lower case k), describes heat flow in response to a temperature gradient
- no gradient, no transfer
- ![[Pasted image 20250205164744.png]]
- ![[Pasted image 20250205164829.png]]
- heat flux density (Qh) - how much energy is flowing through a cross-sectional area
	- related to an area and time
- the law of heat conduction, or Fourier's law: the time rate of heat transfer through a material is proportional to the negative gradient in the temperature, and to the area at right angles, to that gradient, through which the heat is flowing
- influence on thermal conductivity (k)
	- material:
		- `solid > O.M. > air (air is a good insulator)
	- moisture content
		- as water content increases, the transfer resistance is lowered
	- soil compaction
		- improves soil particle contact
	- therefore: a wet, compacted soil would be the worst insulator and the best conductor of heat

K : 


- why might some areas still have snow cover? --> insulation from organic matter on the soil surface as they have more pore space; so blocks energy loss from the deeper soil melting the snow


### Thermal Admittance

![[Pasted image 20250207090557.png]]
- `mineral >  organic soils, and wet > dry soils
- square root of thermal conductivity (k) an heat capacity (C)
	- the higher k would mean that heat transfers more downwards, so that is why a higher k has higher admittance
	- lower admittance means temperature stays at the surface 
- how quickly the surface temperature will change
- low thermal admittance - soils have extreme surface temperature fluctuations
- dry, exposed forest floor surface vs. exposed mineral soil
	- dry exposed forest floor will have low thermal admittance
- mechanical site preparation -- leave some shade! - prevent rapid fluctuations
- mineral is more desirable


### Thermal Diffusivity
- an index, its a measurement of how quickly of subsurface soil temperature would respond to surface soil temperature
- ![[Pasted image 20250207091306.png]]
- `mineral > organic soils; little effect from water content
	- not affected by water content as it affects both numerator and denominator (k and C) 
- soils with high thermal diffusivity undergo large and rapid subsurface temperature response to surface temperature change
- a mineral soil (high l/C) vs and organic soil (low k/C) during spring warming
- do we want this rapid increase?
	- so that roots growing in the subsoil can take advantage of the high temperature
	- Therefore mineral is more desirable
- Mechanical site preparation - to handle organic horizons - scalping - to break up organic horizons and increase thermal diffusivity

For both thermal admittance and thermal diffusivity: exposed organic horizons are the least desirable


## Soil Temperature
determine by:
- site location
	- e.g. latitude, elevation, topogrpahy
- atmospheric weather conditions
	- weather
- physical properties of the soil
	- mostly physical properties
	- compaction
	- water content

How to alter soil temperature:
- remove competing vegetation, thining, shading, albedo
	- species composition
	- species density
	- species distribution
	- partial harvesting
- change the longwave length radiation balance : change the structure of the canopy
	- keep some vegetation - canopy will capture some of that radiation
- Mulching the surface, exposing the mineral soil, tilling the soil, creating mounds or tenches


- Temperature changes:
	- magnitude of change highest in surface soil, more moderated at depth
