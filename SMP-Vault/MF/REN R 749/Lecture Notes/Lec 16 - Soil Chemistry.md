*very complex*, main medium is soil solution
- inorganic reactions between solid phases (minerals, mineral surfaces, and organic matter)
- the liquid phase (near surface and in bulk soil solution)
	- must be liquid phase for cations to exchange
- the gaseous phase - needed for organisms
	- adsorbed on mineral particle surfaces
	- dissolved in soil solution
- soil organisms
	- release gases 
	- transform nitrogen and carbon
	- release carbon dioxide through respiration process - change CO2 concentration in the soil, and will react with liquid phase
	- will release organic compounds through exudation - go into liquid phase and dissolve, be involved in chemical reactions

Soil chemicals, chemical reactions, and processes (atmosphere, microbial nutrients, subsoil streams, primary secondary minerals, ion exchange complex, plant nutrients, specific ion adsorption) - processes: deposition, gas efflux, immobilization, leaching, mineral formation, precipitation, weathering, desorption, sorption, exudation, uptake

- efflux - depends on partial pressure with atmosphere
- microbials will take nutrients from the soil solution if they cannot get enough from organic matter; otherwise from organic matter and release nutrients



### Major soil cations:
- include : Na+, K+, Ca2+, Mg2+, and sometimes Al3+
- Na: input of marine salts - of ocean origin typically, ocean spray - blown onto shore - carries salt into the soil
- Ca (Calcium), and also Mg (magnesium) is the dominant cation in most forest soil solutions
	- 40% of cations in soil solution; or combination of calcium and magnesium
	- determined by soil pH
		- if lower than 4.5, dominant cation could become the Aluminum - aluminum solubility will quickly increase
- Dissolved Al ions are important if pH below about 4.5
	- will hydrolyze and release hydrogen
- Minor cations in the soil solutions include NH4+, and a suite of metals at low concentration (Fe, Mn, Zinc, and Cu)
	- (generally)  ammonium is dominant form of nitrogen in acidic forest soils
	- in Boreal soils, nitrification rate is suppressed in acidic forest soils, so not a lot of nitrate
	- there are disturbances that could increase nitrogen
		- e.g. changing pH by mixing mineral soil - allowing bacteria to thrive more and do nitrification
		- earthworms breaking down organic material, lowering C:N ratio, may increase nitrate
		- addition of nitrogen fixing plants

Cation concentrations in soil solution by forest types

- calcium and magnesium make up the dominant cations
- generally, with more aluminum, less calcium and magnesium
- potassium does not seem to change much between the stands
- higher sodium concentrations (Norway, Loblolly, Red alder, Douglas fir) - sites close to ocean
- hydrogen: associated with aluminum - associated with low pH (high acidity)
	- more nitrification
	- so much ammonium, in aerobic conditions - to nitrate, acidifying process during this oxidation, because a lot of hydrogen is produced

- Red alder
	- produce a lot of nitrogen (it is a nitrogen-fixing species - red alder)
		- a lot of nitrate produced
	- in soil solution, a lot of nitrate == a lot of anions, need equivalent charge of cations to balance the charge; soil solutions do not carry any net charge
	- a lot of aluminum - indication of acidity
- Norway spruce
	- aluminum concentration == high acidity, low pH
	- in eastern usa - acidity from acid deposition (acid rain) - causing soil to become acidified


## Soil Anions

- major anions include: Cl-, SO42-, HC03- and sometimes NO3-
- HC03- (bicarbonate)
	- (from CO2 (soil air) --> carbonic acid --> HCO3-), and sometimes NO3-
	- generally quite mobile depending on cations
	- can cause cation leaching, highly mobile, forms associations with other cations, and must bond with cations to maintain charge balance; when bonded, can leach (otherwise it does not leach by itself)
- NO3-  is typically very low in forest soils, but can be found
- total charge of anions in forest soils: 100 to 500 micromol/L
- Cl-: inputs of salt from the ocean
	- generally associated/correlated with Na in the soil (from the same source - ocean)
- SO4-: deposition of sulfur from polluted air
	- depends on how big the tree canopy is; large canopies are more effective at capturing air pollutants
		- otherwise wet and dry deposition they make their way into the soil from the canopy, contributing to sulfate concentration
- NO3-: formed through nitrification


![[Pasted image 20250312153122.png]]
- nitrate:
	- a lot of nitrate in the red alder stand - due to the nitrogen fixing nature of the red alder
		- potential consequences with so much nitrogen in the soil solution
		- run-off into streams after harvesting
		- nitrate carried away by percolating water
		- don't want pure red alder stands close to the water bodies - could have detrimental effect
			- similar to bicarbonate ion, highly mobile
- alkalinity == bicarbonate -  (loblolly and douglas-fir mostly, slightly in mixed hardwood and white pine)
	- bicarbonate ion - is the measure of alkalinity
	- can take on H ion - reducing the soil acidity-  makes carbonic acid, driving reaction backwards, then can release CO2
- sulfate (high in Norway spruce, loblolly, white pine) - higher air pollution in those areas - 
	- sulfur dioxide concentrations in those areas
	- douglas fir, red alder, mixed hardwood - better at trapping air pollutants and keeping them out of the forest ecosystems
	- now - reduction in air pollution - now reduction in sulfate concentration in soil solutions
		- good: less pollution
		- bad: sulfur is a nutrient; less sulfate concentration in soil; can cause sulfur limitation in soils
- chloride - consistent with sodium - higher in the same stands (first four)
- total anion concentration
	- red alder - 600 in anions, and ~450 for cations in diagrams - not presenting all cations and anions, if we did, the charge to charge would be the same


### Distribution of cations and anions by depth
![[Pasted image 20250312154447.png]]
sulfate, nitrate, chloride, alkalinity (bicarbonate), calcium, hydrogen, aluminum, 
(soil from North Carolina)
- **sulfate** - not in lower depths - takes time to travel down to lower depths - has not reached it yet
	- sulfur may be taken up by roots lower down as well
- **nitrate** - mostly occurring in the forest floor - where nitrification is occurring - very high in the forest floor
	- quite mobile, but not moving down; trees are up-taking nitrogen - their nitrogen requirements are very high
	- also denitrification in soil profile - less oxygen - can allow de-nitification into dinitrogen gas if complete, otherwise nitrous oxide if incomplete (greenhouse gas)
- **chlorid**e - uniform distribution
	- mobile
	- required by plants but not a high demand
- alkalinity - more deeper in the soil
	- HCO3- - bicarbonate - deeper in the soil there is more carbon dioxide (less rapid air exchange), therefore more bicarbonate is produced
	- surface soil - organic, a lot of organic acid, lowers the pH, so less alkalinity (reactions driven the other way, neutralized by the hydrogen produced from acidity in the forest floor)
- Calcium
	-  a lot of nutrient cycling
	- being uptaken by plant and returned to surface floor by litter
- Hydrogen
	- somewhat the reverse of alkalinity - more on forest floor from acid produces, and aerobic
	- lower down, anaerobic, more Co2, more bicarbonate, less hydrogen (neturalized)
- aluminum 
	- same profile as hydrogen as its solubility driven by pH 



- drought will cause concentration to increase because there is less water, less leaching, and less water volume overall
	- too high a concentration == toxicity

- soil solutions contain silicic acid and gases (silica, Si(OH)4)
	- a by-product of weathering, commonly 1 to 10 mg/L in forest soil solutions, doe snot dissociate at normal pH levels, soluble, mostly leaches out of soil
		- for any ion to be leached it must be charged neutral; in this case, it does not dissociate, therefore not charged, and soluble, so it leaches
		- at alkaline pH it does dissociate, so it forms ions, and less leaching
	- Soil solutions exchange gases with the soil atmosphere, and the soil solution contains <1mg/L of CO2 and 10mg/L of O2
		- so, can measure oxygen content in soil solution to test if it is anaerobic' more oxygen in air, more oxygen is dissolved in the soil solution


### organic chemicals
- mineralization of organic matter
- organic acids: excreted by roots and microbes, and leached from the litter layer
- dissolved organic compounds range from simple sugars to large, complex fulvic acid
- examples of major acids include acetic, formic, oxalic, malic, citric, shikimic acids (Japanese flower)
- can be leached from precipitation, from any part of plant (e.g. leaves, steam, etc.), thick forest floor & litter into the soil solution
- accelerates weathering of mineral layers below, dissociating more Al and Fe
	- causes eluviation
- organic acids chelate metals to increase solubility of micronutrients, increase P availability and reduce toxicity of Al3+
	- otherwise P in solution will precipitate with other ions, making it less available, but when chelated with organic acids, it will not react with calcium or aluminum, and keep the soluble
