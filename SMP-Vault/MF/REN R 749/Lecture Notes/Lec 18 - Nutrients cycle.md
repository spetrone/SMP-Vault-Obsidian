## how major nutrient cycle through forest ecosystems
- cycle: a repeated movement through a cyclic pathway in an ecosystem or ecosystems
- nutrients do not disappear, they move from ecosystem to ecosystem and are recycled.
- three modes/levels of nutrient cycling:
	- **geochemical** (highest level)
	- **biogeochemical**
	- **biochemical** (lowest/smallest level)


# Geochemical (geological) cycle
- large, longer-term cycle
	- e.g. release through weathering
- exchange of chemicals between different ecosystems
- constitute the inputs to and losses from biogeochemical cycles
- Two forms:
	a) Gaseous (volatile) cycles (thosenutrients/elements with gaseous phases -makes cycles much more complex)
	 – N - predominant forms: N2, N2O 
	 – C - predominant forms : CO2, CH4, CO
	 – O - predominant forms : O2, N2O, CO2, CO, SO2 
	 – H - predominant forms : CH4, H2S 
	 – S - predominant forms : SO2, H2S
	 
	b) Sedimentary (non-volatile) cycles: All elements

# Biogeochemical Cycles
- cyclical exchange of nutrients between the biota and the physical environment (mainly the soil) in an ecosystem


# The basic processes of biogeochemical cycles

##### UPTAKE
- nutrient uptake by plants
	- from soil solution to the rhizosphere
		- movement from bulk soil solution to root surface requires mass flow and diffusion as nutrients are taken up by root
		- concentration of nutrients decreases by roots and creates a nutrient concentration gradient
		- diffusion is the main mechanism for nutrient movement and uptake by roots
	- from soil minerals and rocks - still requires water
	- by leaves - foliar spray and CO2 uptake
	- via mycotrophy - by mycorrhizaes 
- Uptake = net change in plant nutrient content + replacement of nutrient losses from the plant
- Uptake can only (mostly) be measured indirectly - difficult to measure
	- e.g. measure difference in storage before and after plant uptake to measure the uptake
	- e.g. standing biomass in forest/plant community; especially if measured over time - also factor in that standing biomass has been lost as deadfall - but that needs to be accounted for as part of the nutrient uptake

#### LOSSES
- Nutrient losses from plants
	- leaching: above-or belowground, of inorganic or organic forms
	- defoliation; may result in litterfall, but may also be from herbivory 
		- if herbivory, nutrients will be returned to soil in a new form
	- losses associated with reproduction: fruits and seeds
	- litterfall of leaves, branches, stembark, and roots


- Litter decomposition is affected by:
	- soil fauna and microbial composition
		- how effective are they at breaking down litter and accelerating litter decomposition
	- plant species composition - what kind of litter is coming down
		- research shows that pure stand/monoculture vs mixed species litter is very different - mixed species litter decomposes much faster than litter from a monoculture - because a broader distribution of niches
			- mixed species are better for nutrient cycling
	- litter quality (N concentration and lignin:N ratio)
		- microbes prefer higher nitrogen concentrations
		- lignin are class of compounds that are more resistant to decomposition; higher ratio indicates lower litter quality.
	- litter and forest floor pH (soil chemistry) 
		- pH has a range of effects on soil processes (see past lectures)
	- soil microclimate
	- soil fertility


#### Biogeochemical efficiency of forest ecosystems : trees on infertile soils
- long foliage retention - evergreen tree species
	- foliage retained for multiple years - effects the energy balance of that plant- producing new leaves requires energy and nutrients, and litterfall loses nutrients that were taken up by the tree. 
- relative large root biomass and concentration near soil surface
	- need larger root systems to find nutrients if it is limited
	- more near surface because there are usually more nutrients near surface; 
	- when most roots are distributed in the surface soil, there are downsides
		- less stability and anchoring of the trees
		- less drought resistance 
- mycorrhizae
- leaching resistant cuticles - evolved for high rainfall
	- in both hardwoods and softwoods
- leaves -pointed tips of leaves also prevents leaching as it helps shed water faster
	- most leaches can have nutrients leached from them; some preventative measures like wax layers
		- however, water dripping through the canopy will be measured to have nutrients as a result of leaching from leaves
		- can also uptake some nutrients through their leaves, but that is a different process
- thick bark
	- stemflow also leaches nutrients from the stem
	- often even higher concentration than water dripping through canopy
- chemical defense against losses to herbivores
	- cannot handle being attacked, so need good defenses
- infrequent reproduction
- efficient internal cycling
- slow growth

# Biochemical Cycles
- nutrient cycling within plants - where nutrients are moved around plants to existing parts
	- retranslocation before leaf senescence
		- conserves nutrients
		- greater in infertile soils (esp % retranslocation)
	- retranslocation to new growth - in the new growing season
		- nutrient sinks - new parts are sinks
		- senescing leaves in trees in infertile soils vs fertile soils should show much different % retranslocation is more in infertile soils; however the absolute amount retranslocate may still be greater in fertile soils because they have that much more for nutrients

example - loblolly pine on annual basis for nutrient contributions to nutrient requirements

- phosphorus is highly mobile - 60% can be obtained from internal cycling
- potassium is highly soluble from the leaves - leaching off the leaves is very large
	- then available for plant uptake from the soil
	- protects and controls guard cells of stomata - so there is a lot in the leaves to be leached out
- precipitation - dry or wet deposition - most for K, Calcium and Magnesium (Ca and Mg come from a lot of dust)
- calcium - no biochemical cycling at all - it is not mobile/immobile
	- once fixed into a structure, does not move
	- mostly coming from the soil (70%)
	- high dust contribution (precipitation)
- magnesium - more even distribution
