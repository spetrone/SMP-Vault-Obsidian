- understand the dominant soil formation processes for each soil order
- understand the criteria used for classification of soil at the different levels - Order, Great Group, Subgroup, Family and Series
- understand the general distribution of soil orders
- know where you are in the broad scale and on the landscape
	- understand the processes that might have contributed to the formation of the specific soil
	-  Will need hypothesis for how soil formed, horizon configuration
- Be able to use a key to soil classification - for Canadian Soil Classification - to test initial hypothesis to reject or confirm

#RENR749exam

e.g.
2 hr North of Edmonton driving
- Luvisols - most likely in woodlands
- Gleysolic soils - high water table
- Brunisoils - with less forest vegetation - sandier and less trees providing litter
- Chernozemic soils
- not Podzols - not likely here because the geolocial material in AB is not acidic (except NE at Canadian shield)
## SOIL CLASSIFICATION

- **Order** - dominant soil-forming processes
- **Great Group** - additional dominant soil forming processes or different degree/strengths of dominant soil-forming processes
- **Subgroup** - horizon configuration that indicates the different soil-forming processes involved
- **Family** - parent geological material - minerology 
- Series - uniform soil properties - named by the place where the soil is found - based on detailed soil properties

e.g. 
Podzol - podzolization
- dominated by chemical weathering, with very low pH
- destabilization of clay due to development of soil acidity (from parent material and effects of vegetation)
- high in Aluminum oxides that leach into lower horizons
- Ah horizon (arbic) horizon loses Aluminum and Ferrous oxides (eluviated)
- typical forest soils, develop under influence of forest vegetation
- associated with acidic geologic material

Luvisol
- not dominated by chemical weathering
- higher pH than Podzols
- non-acidic parent geological material - basic/Alkaline
- less rapid chemical weathering - more buffering that prevents pH from decreasing to very low
- slightly acidic conditions which will still de-stabilize clay - but the clay will become suspended in soil solution and will move from A horizon to B horizon without strong chemical weathering
	- some chemical weathering will still occur with other weathering processes
- typically under of forests as well
