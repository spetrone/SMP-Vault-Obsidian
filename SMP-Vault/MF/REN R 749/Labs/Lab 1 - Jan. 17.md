Description:

The soil feels very gritty and falls apart into primary particles when handled or when pressed, either moist or dry. When viewed in an undisturbed soil profile, it has no apparent soil aggregation. The soil will not form a ball, it is not sticky, and it will not form a roll or ribbon. The color of the moist soil is 10YR hue, 8 chroma, 6 value. The boundary between this horizon and the horizon below it forms a completely horizontal line and the transition occurs over 3 cm in depth.

10YR 8 chroma 6 value: brownish yellow

texture: sand

structure:
- type: structureless
- kind: single grain structure
- class: N/A (sand)
- Grade : N/A (sand)


Horizon Boundary: clear smooth


â–ª Include soil color, texture, structure, consistence, plasticity, and horizon boundary

COLOUR - 
- d indicates dry colour
- m indicates moist colour

**Brownish Yellow (10YR 6/8) sand; structureless; non-sticky; single grain structure; clear, smooth boundary.**


*e.g.:Brown (10YR 4/3 d) to dark brown (10YR 3/3 m) sandy clay loam; massive; some textural stratification; slight effervescence*

*Dark brown (10YR 3/3 d, m) clay loam; compound weak, medium prismatic breaking to moderate, medium blocky; gradual, smooth boundary*



notes

- carbonates in dry soils
	- leached from wetter soils
- more carbonates - more buffering, more nutrients (Ca, Mg)

Neutralization Reaction:
*use HCL to look for bubbles (CO2)*

HCL + CaCO2 --> calcium chloride + water + CO2
