-clinical genetics need: Often there is limited evidence to rule out pathogenicity for the variants not observed in a population database, resulting in an increased number of variants of uncertain significance in clinical genetic testing and highlighting the need for continued aggregation of sequencing data to improve the accuracy of genetic test interpretation (Naslavsky et al., [2021](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9160216/#humu24309-bib-0030)).

Improve gain :
--> The gain from increased sample size and improved representation is demonstrated by the decrease in number of unique variants per individual when utilizing the entire gnomAD dataset versus v2 exomes only (Figure [S1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9160216/#humu24309-suppl-0001) and Table [S2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9160216/#humu24309-suppl-0001)). - Lessons from gnomAD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9160216/#:~:text=Variants%20reported%20in%20gnomAD%20have,the%20variant%20and%20the%20site.)
