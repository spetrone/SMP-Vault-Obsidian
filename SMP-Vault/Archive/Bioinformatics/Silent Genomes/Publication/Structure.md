(1) QC (down the road)
(2) Process - governance and approval
	- overarching manuscript referring off to other paper
(3) DB construction and contents


----------------------------------------------------------------  

(1) Background 
	(a) cultural
	 (b) technical scope and limitations
	 (c) NEED
	 
(2) pipeline + QC

(3) evaluation 
	- see [possible analysis](obsidian://open?vault=SMP-Vault&file=Bioinformatics%2FSilent%20Genomes%2FPublication%2FPossible%20Analysis)

(4) application and benefit
- differences between databases
- new variants     

(5) challenges
- many methods throughout the process of building a variant catalogue depend on orthogonal methods  - especially for variant filtering
	- this is not possible to be done effectively without a "gold standard" ground truth set of variants against which to validate

(6) discussion
- its benefit
- future work
	- addition of new sub-populations 
	- long-read sequencing for structural variants
