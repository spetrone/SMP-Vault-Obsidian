- number of variants - C/G, non C/G, variants under purifying selection (e.g. nonsense)
- heterogeneity rate
- unique variants per Individual
	- "Within one individual's exome, there is a mean of 27 ± 13 novel coding variants that are absent in all other gnomAD individuals...For population‐groups not well represented in gnomAD, we would expect these numbers to be even higher." -[ Lessons from gnomAD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9160216/#:~:text=Variants%20reported%20in%20gnomAD%20have,the%20variant%20and%20the%20site.)
- unique variants for population
- variants crossing from rare to not rare & vice versa
