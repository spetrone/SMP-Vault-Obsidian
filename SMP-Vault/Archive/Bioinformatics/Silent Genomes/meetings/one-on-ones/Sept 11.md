- timeline for publication - what is realistic
	- what are my expectations
	- can we start the process now
	- I will be very busy starting in January

publication idea
	- extract 20 genomes from IBVL
		- compare coverage for each individually but aggregate into statistics - mean 
			- compare against IBVL, vs gnomad, vs. gnomad other, gnomad admixed american
		- repeat until means stabilize - take the mean of that
	- take some non-Indigenous genomes and do the same

- IT frustration - aliases are broken on compute nodes - systems does not have a solution
- any updates on project

- what can I do that is best to stay engaged with the lab as much as possible?
