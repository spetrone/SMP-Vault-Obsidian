!!!! RUN FAILED - due to Nextflow bugs running on two queues
	- issue with dev_q and permissions
	- issue with SLURM executor not submitting jobs
	- deepvariant seemed to enter an endless loop 


Configuration
- called HG002-4_GRCh38_1.0
- In Workflow, Population and Individual as HG002-4_GRCh38_1.0
- using hail (not hail2)
- one batch in one sample sheet 
	- location: /mnt/scratch/SILENT/Act3/Processed/Workflow/HG002-4_GRCh38_1.0/samplesheets/sample_sheet_batch_1.csv
- run with profile: GRCh38
- added dev_q to Variant_Catalogue_v1.sh


Run order
- same as run plan for GRCh38 run

Step 1:
main.nf
- only mapping.nf and SNV.nf are run
mapping.nf
- nothing commented out
SNV.nf
- comment out everything except deepvariant, and list_vcf (from GLiNexus onwards)
