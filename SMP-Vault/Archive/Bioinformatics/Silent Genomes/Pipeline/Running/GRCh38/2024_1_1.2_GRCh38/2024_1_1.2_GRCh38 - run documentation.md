commit: https://github.com/wassermanlab/Variant_catalogue_pipeline/commit/75e83cf34b069ed617213c5955e364c5755cdf43 


method:
nextflow.config - changed to only filter out one sample (set filter samples to true but to new file with only F130282)

main.nf -- commented out all except SNV() and removed args from SNV

SNV.nf - removed inputs and created channel from output of 2024_1_1.1_GRCh38 bcf_to_vcf - the normalized and split population vcf
- changed the input to Hail_sample_QC.nf to the new channel
