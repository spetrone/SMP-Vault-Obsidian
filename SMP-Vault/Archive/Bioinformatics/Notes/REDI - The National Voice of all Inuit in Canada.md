- existing and emerging self governments in their different regions
- building modern treaty
- democratic organisation, serving **combined** interests rather than specific interests of member groups 

Importance of distinction of **Inuit** 
- he considers "Indigenous" as a guidepost - but needs further explaining; term cannot stand on its own
- Inuit do not fall under the Indian Act (whole 100 year history of case law of where Inuit belong)
- for delivering services, must determine distinction-based understandings about the legislative space the Inuit fall under
	- used to be citizens of gov. jurisdictions and little more
	- budget was mostly for FN on reserves or under Indian Act
- Less artificial/structural barriers of administration in legislation affecting nationhood for Inuit people in comparison to First Nations

- policy/political context - essential to receive funding or political intention specifically
	- e.g. from policy:
		- UBC pledges to increase Indigenous students by 15% == opening door for inequity among first nations and constitutionality-specific people - e.g. Metis, inuit, FN, and sub-groups
		- often Inuit are misunderstood
		- Indigenous-based programs that are not distinctions-based tend to pass Inuit by or make it very difficult for Inuit to have equity within them
		- so Inuit push for **distictions based legislation, policy and consideration in the way they interact with Canada, academia and other spaces **
		- don't want to speak for others or have others speak on their behalf
		- fully-functioning democracy allows for difference, not homogeneity fitting in a box - cannot allow for self-determination
