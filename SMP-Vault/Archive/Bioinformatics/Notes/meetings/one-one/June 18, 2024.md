Discussion points:
- summer time off
- re-ran GRCh37 data - sex labelling issue resolved
	- run through both MT and SNV subworkflows - some manual modifications to run it that way
	- took 33 hours for SNV + 4.5 hours for MT
	
- Jessica Dennis - committee

- IT issues - cannot change kernel to generic
	- not respectful of my time and agency over my work environment 
	- would rather work from Windows than deal with this

- GPCC for GRCh38 run
	- need to start ASAP
		- first step - BAMS will take up 32 TB, we have 43 TB in scratch space
			- could start first batch of ~1/3 and try to clear space in the meantime
	- doesn't look like adding nodes is an option at all
	- conversation with Jonath - they don't understand nextflow - cannot just pick and choose jobs to run on default to "spill over" into default queue
	- need to clean up storage - don't know how much long term storage we have. Right now the quota seems like it is less than our scratch space - not very useful 
	
- Barriers for my degree
	- Will I get what I want from this?
			- will I grow as a scientist?
				- SGP isolates me
				- cannot talk about my research; everything I do will be questioned. 
				- hands are tied with topics
				- additional barriers as a result of increased security and privacy - the way IT is handling this makes it almost unworkable
					- possibly needs a senior scientist with administrative rights (so also the knowledge of HPC administration, like Phil)
	- Is this a bad fit?
		- coming from a CS background seems like it may be a bad fit; 
		- UBC's program does not facilitate an interdisciplinary transition
			- have to apply to take courses
			- having to use PI as a reference to get into undergrad courses - no room for learning or appreciation for coming up to speed
				- also with undergrads and not in cohort of grad students
			- tells me maybe I should take a more fitting path in graduate school 
		- don't fit at BCCHRI - seems like a place from clinician scientists and wet lab scientists; no peers to grow with on more computational side but also cannot take courses with peers in medical genetics, etc.
