Statistical Inference:

##### Definitions
- **Population** : Entire group of subjects about which we want information
- **Parameter** : the quantity about the population we are interested in 
- **Sample** : the part of the population from which we collect information
- **Statistic (estimate)** : the quantity we are interested in as measured in the sample
- **bias** (systematic error): the bias will favor a certain outcome
	- *selection bias* - when certain sample subjects are more likely to be sampled
	- *non-response bias* - when certain subjects are more likely or less likely to respond during the sampling
	- *voluntary response bias* - when certain subjects are more inclined to respond (e..g for a review of a business) based on certain factors (such as very good or very bad experience)
note * even a relatively small sample can produce an estimate close to the param

### Sampling

1. **Simple Random Sampling** : selecting subjects at random without replacement
2. **Stratified Random Sampling** : divides population into groups of similar subjects called *strata* -> then simple random sampling within each stratum, and the combined
3. Bad Sampling:
	1. Sample of Convenience - not representative of population

Bias and chance error
- since sample drawn at random, estimate is slightly different from parameter due to *chance error* :
		estimate = parameter + bias + chance error
	- chance error gets smaller with larger sample size
	- bias (systematic error) - don't know how large it is, and large samples only continue to have bias at a larger scale
