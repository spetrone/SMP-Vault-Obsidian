 
### **Descriptive Statistics**

- for communicating information and to support reasoning about data
- Summaries: numerical and graphical

#### Graphical Summaries
1. For **qualitative** data -->
	- pie charts (best for percentages)
	- dot plots (better for comparison or proportions)

2. For **quantitative** data 
	- use number line graphs
	- **Bar graph** (like a dot plot on its side)
	- **Histogram** --> total area = 100%
		- areas of blocks are proportional to frequency 
		- bar graph where blocks have different widths
		- Information:
			- Density (crowing): the *height* of the bar - how many per unit of scale - high density = high height, small width, 
			- Percentage (relative frequency) - density x unit scale == height x width
	- **Box Plot** (AKA Box-and-whisker plot)
		- visualises 5 key numbers:
			- minimum, maximum, median, first quartile, 3rd quartile
		- has less information than histogram but takes less space
		- can show multiple datasets on same graph so you can compare more
	- **Scatterplot** : for data that comes in *pairs*
		- plotted in coordinate system
		- visualises relationship between two variables

Provide CONTEXT:
- use small multiples to provide context as observed data is usually compared to a reference. E.g.

Important Values:
1. Spread of data
	1. interquartile range
	2. standard deviation
			(may have n-1 in denom)

	Combinations:
	1. mean + standard deviation --> sensitive to large or small numbers or skewed data
	2. median + interquartile range --> better for skewed data or when there are  very large or small values
