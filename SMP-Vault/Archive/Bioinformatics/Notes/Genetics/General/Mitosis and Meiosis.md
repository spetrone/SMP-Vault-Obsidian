#### MITOSIS / CELL CYCLE

Cell cycle
- G0 phase --> no more division. e.g. fully differentiated neuron cell
- Interphase - no major changes in division, but many molecular changes
	- G1 accumulate molecular changes such as proteins
	- S phase - DNA replications
		- sister chromatids are created (dyads); each single chromatid is a monad in the dyad.
		- joined by kinetochore proteins surrounding the centromere (DNA) - a highly repetitive region 
	- G2 phase - cell accumulates materials and machinery needed for cell division
	
- M Phase - MITOSIS : purpose to split duplicated DNA equally into the nucleus of two identical daughter cells
	- uses mitotic spindle aparatus (astral, polar and kinetochoremicrotubules) - attached to centrosomes at the two poles of the cell (each with a pair of right-angled centrioles); plant cells do not have centrosomes, the extranuclear membranes acts in place
	1. prophase: nuclear membrane dissolves, centromeres move apart, microtubules beigin forming, chromatids condense further
	2. Prometaphase: the nuclear memrane is in small vessicles, mitotic spindle is formed and in place
	3. metaphase: kinetochores attached to microtubules from both centromeres, now aligned on metaphase plate in centre
	4. Anaphase: sister chromatids break apart, move to either pole
	5. Telophase: chromatids reach separate poles, decondense, nuclear membranes re-form
- Cytokinesis : segregates nucleus and full set of organelles into two daughter cells; contractile ring on cytoplasmic surface of plasma membrane forms cleavage furrow that ingresses and pinches cell into two
	- IN PLANTS: two daughter cells sparated by a the formation of a cell plate created by Golgi-derived vesicles carrying cell wall materials to equator of dividing cell - starts in middle to outer edges


#### MEIOSIS 
- Produces haploid, genetically unique cells
- Unlike mitosis - two divisions after replication (meiosis I and II)

Starts as mitosis does with G1 phase, S phase and G2 phase. Then:

##### MEIOSIS I
1. Synapsis: sister chromatids physically cconnec via synaptonemal complex, creating a bivalent AKA tetrad (four modads, two dyads)
2. Chiasma formation - CROSSING OVER: physically exchanges pieces of chromosome - both break at same location in chromatid and attaches to its homologue
	1. depending on species, between 2 to 20+ crossovers / multiple chiasmata
3. Pro-metaphase : spindles form and attach to tetrads
4. Metaphase: tetrads align along metaphase plate; the arrangement of dyads is random (i.e. mother vs. father) 
	1. one sister chromatid attached to a kinetochore for one pole (rather than both)
5. Anaphase: sister chromatids within tetrad are separated; stay as dyads
6. Telophase; now considered haploid; dyads at each pole, often nucleus re-forms; Now 23 pairs of the same chromosomes, rather than 23 pairs of homologous chromosomes.

##### MEIOSIS II
- same steps as mitosis, except for half the number of chromosomes
	- 23 pairs line up rather than 46 in humans
