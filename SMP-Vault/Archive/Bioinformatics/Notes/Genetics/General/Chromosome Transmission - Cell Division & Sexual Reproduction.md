#### Chromosomes
- structures within living cells that contain the genetic material 
- bound with proteins into a complex called **chromatin** 

###### Prokaryotes : "prenucleus", no nucleus in the cell 
- usually have single circular chromosome in a nucleoid
###### Eukaryotes "true nucleus" 
- include some protists, fungi and multicellular species (plants, animals)
- cells have more internal membranes enclosing more specialised compartments and membrane-bound organelles
- **nucleus** is organelle bounded by two membranes constituting the nuclear envelope
	- contains DNA
	- DNA outside nucleus in other organelles (e.g. in mitochondria) is called *extranuclear*
