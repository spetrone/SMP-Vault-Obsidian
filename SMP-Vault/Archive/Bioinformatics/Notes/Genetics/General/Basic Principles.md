###  Review: Cells
- molecules: nucleic acids (deoxyribonucleic acid, ribonucleic acid), proteins, carbohydrates, lipids
	- form macro molecules == larger molecules made up of smaller sub-units
	- macromolecules make up organelles
	- often membranes separated different organelles and processes
	- <u>proteome:</u> collection of proteins that a cell makes at a given time
- energy : breaking of chemical bonds during degradation (like hydrolysis) provides energy to drive cellular processes


### DNA
- Deoxyribonucleic acid
- linear sequence of nucleotides
	- Adenine (A) - purine
	- Thymine (T) - pyrimidine
	- Guanine (G) - purine
	- Cytosine (C) - pyrimidine
	- Uricil (U) - pyrimidine

**Karyotype**: An individual's complete set of chromosomes

**Gene Expression:** the process of using gene sequence to affect the characteristics of cells

**Central dogma of genetics:** the pathway of gene expression from DNA to RNA



## GENES AND TRAITS
- **Morphological** traits: appearance, structure, form
- **Physiological** traits: ability of organism to perform a function
- **Behavioural** traits: how organism responds to its environment

genes start at the **molecular level** -- affect proteins at the **cellular level** -- are visible at the **organism level** and produce sets of attributes at the **population level**
- molecular --> EXPRESSION OF GENES
- cellular --> PROTEIN FUNCTION AFFECTING CELL STRUCTURE AND FUNCTION
- organism level --> phenotypes of MORPHOLOGICAL AND PHYSIOLOGICAL TRAITS
- population level --> PREVALENCE OF TRAITS IN A POPULATIONS and further AS A SPECIES

- traits caused by genetic variation; Types of genetic variation
	- gene mutations : differences within a gene sequence
	- structural variants : loss, rearrangement, reattachment of large segment of chromosome
	- chromosomal variants (# of chromosomes)
- **morphs:** contrasting forms of the same species
- traits also governed by environment
- Variation and mutation allows for evolution through natural selection

- Model organisms: commonly studies species with advantages for experimentation (many genes also found in humans, fast cycles, easily grown, etc.)
	- mus musculus, arabidopsis thaliana, Dosophilia melanogaster, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli, Caenorhabditis elgans

- Fields of genetics: 
	- transmission genetics
	- molecular genetics : molecular features of DNA (e.g. cause and effects of loss of function variants)
	- population genetics : genetic variation and its role in evolution
	- cytogenetics: field of genetics involving the microscopic examination of chromosomes


Ploidy:
- number of copies of chromosomes:
	- diploid (humans somatic cells and commonly in sexually reproducing species) = 2 copies of **homologs/homologous pairs**
		- somatic cells are diploid
	- haploid - one copy (human gametes aka germ cells
	- **karyotype** : the organized representation of chromosomes within a cell - when ready for cell splitting i.e. two complete sets of chromosomes
	-

**locus:** the physical location of a gene on a chromosome




Meaning of terms:
- Normal - common AKA "*wild type*"
- abnormal - rare (< 1% usually) - "*mutant*"
