### Ecology 
#### Mychorrizal fungi
- what is the interaction? 
- less mortality with help of fungi? - should be citable
- 

### Effect on Adaptation
#### Genomic variation & genome changes
- older vs. younger trees & somatic mutation levels 
- epi-genetic changes, methylation
	- what ecological factors affect methylation
	- biotic vs abiotic stressor effects?
	- connection with fungi affect anything? What happens to the fungi and their epigenetics?

		- [# Epigenetic control of heavy metal stress response in mycorrhizal versus non-mycorrhizal poplar plants](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11356-013-2072-4)
	- look into miRNA - through changes in miRNA (Bazin _et al_. [2012](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/plb.12917?saml_referrer#plb12917-bib-0007); Wu _et al_. [2016](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/plb.12917?saml_referrer#plb12917-bib-0048)). 

- More seeds produced under stress/when dying? --> more variation or better chance of surviving the change?

### Nutrients & Carbon cycling
- does tree dump carbon back? how much?
- does tree dump nutrients back, how much?
- how does tree signal other trees?



Possible addition later...
### In the context of forest management
- can we control or instigate the process of tree death?
- how will that alter the ecosystem?
- preserving the soil
- will it preserve more carbon?
- how will it effect the wood?
