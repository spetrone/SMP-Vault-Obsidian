#### Brief Evolutionary History

- **heterotropshs:** obtain energy that is produced by external sources
- **autotrophs**: most plants, produce own energy; most efficient is photosynthesis


- prior to oxygen in atmosphere ~500-700 million years ago, when cellular respiration became possible, there were only prokaryotes, then there were eukaryotes
- most species are eukaryotes, except archaea and bacteria
- Plants developed to tackle challenges during transition of life to land, largely to transfer nutrients

#### PLANTS
- **Roots**: anchor in ground & collect water
- **Stems**: Provide support for photosynthetic organs
- **Leaves**: Perform photosynthesis
- **Epidermis**: outermost layer of cells
- **Cuticle**: on all above-ground epidermis, waxy, retards water loss (also inhibits necessary gas exchange)
- **Stomata:** (*sing. stoma*), consist of a pair of epidermal guard cells with small opening - responds to environment and physiological signals to help plan maintain a balance between its water losses and O2 & CO2 requirements

**Annuals**: plants with a one year lifespan
**Perennials**: plants living longer than a year
**Cork:** woody covering of stem on (frequently) perennials
